Bitcoin rebounded to the $21,000 level after a dip to just over $20,000.Bitcoin reversed Wednesday’s decline even as U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell announced a 75 basis-point interest rate increase, the biggest in over 28 years. The move is part of the Fed's effort to bring down inflation. The Fed also said it will continue to reduce the size of its balance sheet at the rate announced in May.A run in bitcoin and positive sentiment in the broader market saw prices of major cryptocurrencies increase. Ether (ETH) rose 11%, Polkadot’s DOT added 15%, while Cardano’s ADA and XRP rose some 7%, data from CoinGecko show.Still, some analysts remain skeptical about a sustained rally and said possible contagion risks from within the crypto industry, such as troubles at crypto lender Celsius and crypto fund Three Arrows Capital facing possible insolvency, could add to selling pressure.“The 'don’t fight the Fed' mantra has never been more relevant and volatility is anything but a surprise on the days of the Federal Reserve policy announcements,” Mikkel Morch, executive director at crypto fund ARK36, said in an email. “It seems that last week’s CPI print and subsequent comments by the Fed members already spooked investors so much that by the time of the actual meeting, a 75 basis point rate hike was already largely priced in.”“It now appears that we can expect the Bitcoin price to hold the $20K level. Likely, it will consolidate there for the foreseeable future and maybe even tag the $24,000 resistance unless there is more contagion risk from one of the troubled projects in the DeFi space,” Morch said.Outside of majors, Tron’s TRX jumped as much as 27% as the TronDAO, a community-run effort for the future development of Tron, deployed over $220 million to buy the token in the open market to protect the ecosystem's stablecoin, USDD.Other notable gainers were Uniswap’s UNI token with a 16% gain and the token of layer 1 protocol Elrond (EGLD) rising 21%. Underperforming tokens included shiba inu (SHIB) and KuCoin shares (KCS), which added less than 5.5%.The crash has now wiped over £300 billion from the combined value of crypto assets(Bloomberg) -- Crypto companies that have been trying to go public since last year’s boom remain stuck in a lengthy back-and-forth with US regulators, adding to the pile of challenges facing the industry.Most Read from BloombergChina Says It May Have Detected Signals From Alien CivilizationsStocks Jump as Powell Soothes Wall Street’s Nerves: Markets WrapFed Hikes 75 Basis Points; Powell Says 75 or 50 Likely in JulyWorld’s Central Banks Got It Wrong, and Economies Pay the PriceAmericans Are BuildAfter a week of announcements in NSW to improve the affordability of childcare and early learning, today Victorian parents are getting a turn.

The asset has bounced several times from those levels over the past week, suggesting interest from buyers at those prices.Friday saw weakness in several major cryptos, with Cardano’s ADA tokens falling 7% in the past 24 hours to lead losses among major tokens. Solana’s SOL fell 6%, ether (ETH) lost 2.3% and XRP fell 0.8%.Overall, crypto market capitalization dropped by 2.3% to $1.28 trillion, continuing a slide from a capitalization of over $2.2 trillion in March.The fall in crypto prices came ahead of the release of the CPI report scheduled for 8:30 a.m. ET Friday. Economists expect inflation in May to rise over 0.7% from April, meaning an 8.3% rise since May of last year, according to CNBC.Inflation concerns have contributed to bitcoin’s fall in the past several weeks. In May, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates by the largest amount since 2000 as it seeks to tighten monetary policy following $2 trillion in stimulus in the past few years. The Fed's tightening has caused a drop in global stocks, which carried over to losses in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.Earlier in April, Goldman Sachs (GS) analysts said in a note that the Fed's aggressive measures to control inflation could result in a recession, which added to investor concerns.While bitcoin has closely followed the price movements of risky technology stocks in the past few months, some market observers remain upbeat about the long-term growth of cryptocurrencies.“Generally, the correlation gap between cryptocurrencies and stock markets is long-term good news as it attracts the attention of professional investors,” Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior market analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email.“Weakness in equity and bond markets, sagging gold and the murky outlook for the real estate market are turning to cryptocurrencies as another tool in a diversified portfolio,” he added.After a week of announcements in NSW to improve the affordability of childcare and early learning, today Victorian parents are getting a turn.

Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands just below the $1,800 level, about where it was perched a day ago and for the past few weeks. Other major altcoins were mixed, with LTC off more than 3% at one point and ADA and CRO down about a percentage point. Among the winners, LINK continued its recent surge, rising over 6% at one point, while SOL was up more than 3%.""Bitcoin continues to hover around the $30,000 level as crypto traders await a key inflation report that could sway market expectations as to what the Fed may do in September,"" Oanda Senior Analyst Americas Edward Moya wrote in an email.The European Central Bank's (ECB) announcement that it would begin raising interest rates next month sent first major European and then U.S. indexes falling with the latter taking a last-hour dive to post their biggest decline since mid May. Technology companies suffered among the roughest batterings, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropping 2.7% and the tech component of the S&P 500 off about the same. The ECB announced it would hike rates a quarter of a point in July to combat inflation and that it would raise rates additionally later in the year.The U.S. CPI is widely expected to show inflation still percolating well above 8%, its highest level in four decades. The U.S. Central Bank will likely raise interest rates another half-percentage point at its next meeting to match its most recent rate hike last month. Meanwhile energy prices continued to hover around 2022 highs with Brent crude oil, a benchmark of global energy markets, closing at about $123 per barrel, a roughly 60% increase from the start of the year.""Inflation is hot and it will remain hot and rate hike expectations should continue to climb after each monthly inflation report,"" Moya wrote.Cryptos suffered their own latest, mini-outbreak of bad news with separate reports that South Korean authorities are investigating TerraForm Labs for the collapse of its terraUSD stablecoin (UST), and that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was probing whether the Singapore-registered firm had violated U.S. laws in its marketing of UST and the LUNA token that supported it.""This has been a messy several weeks for crypto filled with lawsuits, scams, and fading interest as prices have remained anchored,"" Moya wrote. ""Crypto needs a few fresh catalysts to break out of these doldrums and that could take a while.""S&P 500: 4,017 -2.3%DJIA: 32,272 -1.9%Nasdaq: 11,754 -2.7%Gold: $1,847 -0.2%Analyst Opinion Differs on the Ethereum Ropsten MergeEthereum’s Ropsten public testnet underwent a “Merge” on Wednesday ahead of an eventual rollout on the main network. The move comes ahead of a much-awaited shift from the current proof-of-work (PoW) network to a proof-of-stake (PoS) design.PoW refers to a validation model that relies on entities called miners that use computing resources to validate transactions and support a blockchain network. PoS, on the other hand, relies on network ""validators"" who lock up relevant tokens on nodes to process transactions and support the network.PoS systems are considered more environmentally friendly than PoW and help create a cheaper and faster blockchain. A move to PoS would alleviate recurrent criticisms of Ethereum’s network, such as the network’s fees. Fees, for example, crossed over $12,000 worth of ether (ETH) per transaction earlier this year when non-fungible tokens (NFT) related to the popular Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem were offered to the public.Switching the blockchain from one consensus mechanism to another is a complex change, which requires multiple tests on testnets like Ropsten before they are finally deployed on the mainnet.Currently, the Beacon Chain is the PoS coordination chain that already has validators creating and validating new blocks in tandem with the main PoW execution chain. Once the PoS chain has been adequately tested and secured, the two chains will merge and Ethereum will continue as a PoS blockchain.A shift to PoS will cause a shift in ether’s market dynamics. Supply would likely decline as fewer coins would likely be issued, while expected yields of over 7% to stakers would increase demand for ether.Such forecasts have led to positive sentiment among investors, with some, like prominent billionaire technology investor Mark Cuban, stating they are “very bullish” on the asset’s future.Market observers and developers within the crypto space remain mixed in reaction, however.Brad Yasar, the founder of decentralized finance (DeFi) platform EQIFI, said in an email that while a shift to PoS comes with benefits, Ethereum’s PoW model was its main feature thus far.“As much as a transition from POW to POS is seen as the next step in Ethereum's future and is expected to solve several main challenges the blockchain is facing, it is important to note that PoW was Ethereum's DNA,” Yasar said. “Newer blockchains that copied Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and changed the validation mechanism or block structures or fees have launched since then, yet none has been able to take over Ethereum.”Yasar stated ether’s recent price drop was partly due to “the uncertainty among the community that has been supporting Ethereum by mining on it.”“Miners are an important segment of any PoW blockchain community that Ethereum will alienate once it is goes PoS. The long-term impact of this change can be a significant one as many supporters of Ethereum are going to leave [the blockchain] for other opportunities,” Yasar explained.“All the benefits of lower carbon footprint, lower fees, etc., may not be enough to keep Ethereum relevant in a post-PoW world,” he added.Others, however, remain upbeat about the Merge’s prospects, especially considering the significantly lessening of the environmental impact.“We should not underestimate how important Ethereum’s switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake will be,” said Choise.com director of strategy Austin Kimm in a Telegram message. “This is just a test, but it at least means that Ethereum is on track to do what it promised.”“Billions of complicated processing calculations will no longer be required and it is expected that this will reduce the energy consumption to negligible levels. Multiply this across literally thousands of tokens created on Ethereum and this should be a major milestone in global crypto adoption,” Kimm said, adding his firm remains “very bullish about the future of Ethereum.”Estimates for a full rollout to PoS on the mainnet are in the final quarter of this year. A few features, such as the ability to withdraw staked ETH, however, will have to wait until after the Merge is complete, as previously reported.Once Ethereum shifts from PoW to PoS, validators who have staked the required 32 ETH will take over the role of adding new blocks to the blockchain.Editor's Note: Technician's Take is on hiatus today.Consensus 2022 by CoinDeskRelease of U.S. Consumer Price Index9:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(1:30 a.m. UTC): China consumer price index (MoM/YoY/May)In case you missed it, CoinDesk TV is covering the Consensus conference:Creativity Reimagined: Web 3 and the New Creative CanvasWeb 3 is unlocking a creative renaissance, giving artists new tools to express their intent, and demanding new skill sets to succeed.

For now, sentiment among crypto traders is still bearish, albeit less so compared with last week, according to the bitcoin Fear & Greed index.Meanwhile, most alternative cryptos (altcoins) outperformed bitcoin on Thursday, indicating a greater appetite for risk among short-term traders. Typically, alts rise more than BTC during up markets because of their greater risk profile. And the opposite is true during down markets.Two standouts on Thursday were Chainlink's LINK token and Helium's HNT token, which both rallied by as much as 10% over the past 24 hours. And over the past week, Cardano's ADA token rose by 9%, compared with BTC's flat performance over the same period.●Bitcoin (BTC): $30,038, −0.31%●Ether (ETH): $1,784, −0.18%●S&P 500 daily close: 4,019, −2.36%●Gold: $1,850 per troy ounce, −0.13%●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.04%Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.Bitcoin's funding rate, or the cost of funding long and short positions in the perpetual futures market, has been at or around neutral levels over the past six months. The previous record duration of a compressed funding environment lasted for four months from May to October last year.""This consistency of neutral to negative funding rates is unprecedented in the BTC [perpetual market] history,"" Arcane Research wrote in a report this week. That could be driven by the prolonged bearish sentiment among crypto traders, or the entrance of more funds taking advantage of the base neutral funding rate of 0.01% to earn a consistent yield, according to Arcane.Typically, funding rates have seen sharp swings, which reflected extreme bullish/bearish sentiment around price highs and lows. Over time, however, traders have been less willing to pay for additional long or short exposure, possibly indicating a lower appetite for leverage or a neutral outlook among market participants.Currently, funding rates are making minor lows, which could signal stabilization in prices after extreme sell-offs. For example, BTC's dip last weekend sent Bybit’s funding rate to the lowest level since February, similar to what occurred after BTC's sharp drop toward $25,300 on May 10.SEC investigating company behind terraUSD: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is looking into whether Terraform Labs – the Singapore-registered firm that created the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin and luna token – violated U.S. laws regarding how it marketed the crypto coins.

I’m Bradley Keoun, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights. (Lyllah Ledesma is off.)Price point: Bitcoin recaptures $30K, though analysts warn that further declines may lie ahead.Market Moves: The Wall Street giant Citigroup warns that last month's collapse of Terra's LUNA token and UST ""algorithmic stablecoin"" may have delayed cryptocurrency adoption, Will Canny reports.Bitcoin (BTC) climbed back above $30,000, a key pivot point, but the price appeared to be slipping in early U.S. trading hours.Cryptocurrencies were still broadly higher on Wednesday versus 24 hours earlier, with Chainlink's LINK jumping 14% and Cardano's ADA up 11%.The gains came even as traditional markets struggled, with investor fears rising over ongoing efforts by central banks globally to tighten monetary policy – to contain soaring inflation.Bitcoin's (BTC) price has tumbled 34% this year as Federal Reserve reserve rate increases and balance-sheet shrinkage have reduced excess liquidity in financial markets.The European Central Bank (ECB), led by President Christine Lagarde, is scheduled to meet Thursday and is expected to convey its own plans for tightening monetary policy. Money markets are pricing in 1.25 percentage points of ECB interest-rate increases over the rest of 2022, according to the German lender Deutsche Bank.""Many crypto traders are still nervous about one last plunge,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at the foreign-exchange brokerage Oanda, wrote Tuesday.The analysis firm Glassnode warned Tuesday that a ""full-scale capitulation scenario"" could occur at a BTC price range from $20,560 to $23,600. Blockchain data suggests that bitcoin miners are liquidating some of their holdings in response to a squeeze on profits.""The highest probability is that the market is within the second and historically final capitulation phase of a bitcoin bear market,"" they wrote.The giant U.S. bank Citigroup argues in a new research piece that a slowdown in crypto adoption might be one of the biggest consequences from Terra's collapse, Will Canny reports for CoinDesk.Last month's price crash in Terra's LUNA tokens (since renamed LUNC) and the crash of the ""algorithmic stablecoin"" UST below its $1 peg wiped out at least $40 billion of market value.According to Citi, nagging concerns about stablecoins generally have led to outflows from Tether's USDT. (Fitch Ratings estimated Tuesday that the market capitalization of all stablecoins shrank to $162 billion at the end of May from $188 billion at the end of March.)Such concerns have most likely compounded declines in crypto markets, the report said.According to Citi, “tentative evidence suggests a reduction in trading volumes and futures positions but not wholesale declines in investor interest in the space.""“Volatility has affected user adoption,” the Wall Street giant said.Link to full story: Citi Says Crypto Market Volatility Has Affected User AdoptionBy Oliver KnightThe Osmosis network was halted by core developers and validators at 2:57 UTC following the emergence of an exploit that may have led to about $5 million being drained from liquidity pools.The bug was brought to light by a community member on the Osmosis subreddit, although the post was deleted by the forum's moderator.The exploit came to light when a user deposited funds to a liquidity pool before instantly withdrawing it. The value of the withdrawal was unintentionally 50% higher than the deposit.The team took 12 minutes to halt the chain after the exploit had emerged, according to a Discord post by Osmosis community analyst, RoboMcGobo.In an update on Twitter, Osmosis wrote: ""Liquidity pools were NOT 'completely drained.' Devs are fixing the bug, scoping the size of losses (likely in the range of ~$5M), and working on recovery.""The Osmosis token (OSMO) is down 7% over the past 24 hours, according to trades on MEXC.Link to full story: Osmosis Chain Halted Amid Possible $5M ExploitOcean Protocol Leans on NFTs to Drive Decentralized Data Markets Version 4 of Ocean Protocol uses NFTs for more flexible handling and the monetization of curated data sets.Citi Says Crypto Market Volatility Has Affected User Adoption Concerns about stablecoins following UST’s collapse have exacerbated declines in digital asset prices, the bank said.Algorithmic Stock Adviser Delphia Raises $60M Ahead of Rewards Token Launch Investors will earn Delphia Data Tokens for sharing personal shopping and social media data with the advisor.Outgoing French Lawmaker Calls for Fossil-Based Crypto Mining Ban, DAO Legal Status Europe needs to stop dithering and capture the crypto opportunity, Pierre Person said.DeversiFi Launches Cross-Chain Swaps for Bridgeless DeFi Transactions The DEX aims to eliminate the gas fees and extra steps associated with multi-chain ecosystems, even if it sacrifices network security.Solana Commits $100M to Support South Korean Crypto Projects The fund, created by Solana Ventures and the Solana Foundation, will focus on virtual gaming, and will invest in NFT and DeFi projects.Scaling Ethereum Beyond the Merge: Danksharding Danksharding would take a massive step toward turning Ethereum layer 2 networks into first class citizens.Today’s newsletter was edited by Bradley Keoun and produced by Parikshit Mishra and Stephen Alpher.Companies have been competing fiercely for skilled workers due to widespread labour shortages.

Ether, the second largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands at roughly $1,730, down about 6% over the same period. Other major altcoins that had risen significantly earlier in the day, including SOL and ADA were more in the red, as investors wrestled with the months-long flow of more troubling news.Still, a number of analysts said that Bitcoin was unlikely to take any deeper drops for the time being.""I think we may be putting in a bottom here with Bitcoin,"" Greg King, CEO and founder of crypto asset manager Osprey Funds, told CoinDesk's First Mover program.King noted that the presence of institutional investors has differentiated the latest price slump from previous crypto winters in 2013 and 2018 when bitcoin lost over 80% of its value. Bitcoin has currently dropped about 60% since hitting its all-time peak just short of $70,000 in November.""Institutional buyers are buying this dip and then don't forget the macro environment,"" King said, noting the four-decade high inflation rate in the U.S. ""Zero yield assets such as gold and Bitcoin do very well"" at these times, he added.Stocks rose slightly on Monday with the tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500 increasing about a half percentage point, as was the case for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Gold, a traditional safe-haven asset, fell about a half-percentage point. Investors were buoyed by last week's job report that suggested the economy might not plunge into recession any time soon. Some analysts also believe that inflation has peaked, although markets will be nervously eyeing this Friday's consumer price index report, which is expected to show inflation remaining stubbornly above 8%, a four-decade high.Volatility continued to fade in crypto markets, while the fear and greed index ticked higher, although it is still registering squarely in extreme fear territory. Bitcoin has been trading in a tight range between $28,000 and $31,500 for the past month as investors wait for clearer signals about whether the economy will sink into recession or power through its current headwinds.King believes the increasing correlation between cryptos and stocks will reverse to some degree, calling it a ""reflection of this kind of wild situation in macro markets where we have awful conditions and so it's more of a risk-on, risk-off type of mindset.""""I personally think that crypto will emerge as – certainly things like Bitcoin – as a relative safe haven as we continue to chop through an uncertain macro environment and especially if rates continue to rise and equities continue to tank, but I don't think that a long term correlation makes a lot of sense,"" he said.Hong Kong Is Hardly Laissez-Faire When It Comes to CryptoHong Kong’s political freedom has eroded thanks to Beijing, though its laissez-faire economics – which have won accolades from the likes of Cato and the Heritage Foundation as the ""world’s freest economy"" – are still in its DNA.For crypto, this isn’t the case. There are rules aplenty.The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission’s (SFC) issued a memo this week reminding investors about the inherent risks of non-fungible tokens (NFT).“As with other virtual assets, NFTs are exposed to heightened risks, including illiquid secondary markets, volatility, opaque pricing, hacking and fraud. Investors should be mindful of these risks, and if they cannot fully understand them and bear the potential losses, they should not invest in NFTs,” the SFC wrote.All of which is true.But the problem is this looks like the beginning of a regulatory push into the NFT market by the SFC, which currently says that most NFTs fall outside its regulatory remit. And when the SFC regulates crypto, it takes a heavy hand. This severity is ironic considering the accolades that Hong Kong has received by the likes of Koch Foundation-funded Cato, which advocates for less economic regulation.Consider the SFC’s prohibition on non-accredited investors trading crypto at exchanges. If this were the case in the United States, Coinbase (COIN) wouldn’t have a business model; its total market would be limited to the 13.6 million accredited investors in the country. For all the criticism the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has gotten about harming domestic innovation because of restrictive rules on crypto, banning non-accredited investors from trading crypto is something even SEC head Gary Gensler wouldn’t do.Then there are Hong Kong’s murky rules on crypto infrastructure. Stakeholders have previously complained that the rules spread across too many different agencies for things like custody. Some critics have  even called it a “double standard.” The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, its central bank, only recently greenlit crypto companies to open bank accounts – provided they only interact with accredited investors.All this was too much for Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX. The crypto exchange that once called Hong Kong home decamped for the Bahamas in September, citing Hong Kong’s hostility towards crypto and never-ending quarantine regime.For the world’s freest economy, there sure are a lot of heavy-handed rules regarding the future of finance. NFTs are likely to be next.Bitcoin Bounces Above $27K-$30K Support Zone; Resistance at $33K-$35KBitcoin (BTC) experienced another relief bounce over the past 24 hours, similar to what occurred last weekend. The cryptocurrency is holding support above $27,000 and $30,000, which could keep short-term buyers active.BTC is up by 4% over the past 24 hours and is down by 1% over the past week. That suggests the current price range remains intact, which is typical after several weeks of negative returns.The recent downtrend in price has stabilized above the May 12 low at $25,338, which contributed to rising momentum on the daily chart. For example, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) returned above the 50 neutral mark Monday after reaching extreme oversold levels on May 9.Still, momentum remains negative on the weekly and monthly charts, which means an upswing in BTC could be limited.

On Thursday you woke up excited to start a new gig in the exciting world of digital assets. Then you got a god-damned form email titled “Update to your Coinbase offer” and the update was “whoops, nevermind.” Seriously, Coinbase, get your act together. This is shameful behavior. (CoinDesk columnist David Z. Morris) ... ""Yet, while Coinbase once again manages to excel in its public bumbling, it is not alone in facing headwinds. As the crypto economy slows, exchanges have been among the first to reveal cutbacks, in part because more of them are public or regulated firms. Robinhood (HOOD), which offers equity and crypto trading and saw hypergrowth during the coronavirus pandemic, has reversed course to cut 9% of staff. Mexican exchange Bitso and Middle Eastern exchange Rain Financial have also made cuts. The layoff announcement from the Winklevoss twins’ Gemini exchange may be the most provocatively framed. In announcing it is cutting 10% of staff, Gemini predicted the entire industry was “entering a period of stasis,” and explicitly warned of a coming 'crypto winter.'"" (CoinDesk columnist David Z.

I’m Bradley Keoun, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights. (Lyllah Ledesma is off.)Price point: Bitcoin finally posts a winning week, snapping record losing streak. Friday's U.S. CPI report for May could show inflation slowing.Market Moves: Decentralized exchanges are winning on-chain flows, Cameron Thompson reports.Bitcoin (BTC) was higher Monday, after snapping a record nine-week losing streak.As of press time bitcoin was up 6.2% over the past 24 hours, to about $31,500.During the seven days through Sunday, the bitcoin price inched up 1.5% – barely mentionable for the notoriously volatile cryptocurrency except for the fact that it was the first weekly gain in 10 weeks. From late March through late May, a steady market erosion took bitcoin from about $48,000 to as low as $25,400.Now analysts are wondering if the latest price bounce might mean the bottom is in.""The new week is off to a promising start,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email. ""It is worth paying attention to the change in the trend.""Cardano's ADA token, Solana's SOL and Polygon's MATIC tokens were all enjoying double-digit-percentage gains on Monday.In traditional markets, U.S. stock futures were higher along with European indexes. Traders were awaiting a European Central Bank meeting later this week where officials led by President Christine Lagarde are expected to announce an end to bond purchases and signal rate increases ahead, likely in July – part of a campaign to head off surging inflation.The big economic data point in the U.S. this week will be the Consumer Price Index report on Friday, June 10. The CPI report could provide clues as to how the economy is responding to the Federal Reserve's campaign to slow inflation.According to FactSet, economists estimate the CPI for May probably was probably 8.2% higher than 12 months ago, representing a decrease from April's pace of 8.3% and March's 8.5%.Decentralized exchanges are winning on-chain flows, Cameron Thompson reports.Decentralized exchanges (DEX) are rising in popularity.From April 2021 to April 2022, Web 3 users sent $224 billion in on-chain value to DEXs, outstripping centralized exchanges like Coinbase which combined for $175 billion over the same period, according to Chainalysis.Chainalysis Economist Ethan McMahon told CoinDesk that the move from centralized exchanges (CEX) to DEXs began in 2020’s DeFi summer and carried through the NFT boom of 2021. DEXs first cleared 50% market share in September 2020, according to the report. In June 2021, the number hit its peak at 80%. Based on the latest report, the market share now stands around 55%.If DEXs continue to increase in popularity, a regulatory crackdown might be on the way. “If [regulation] serves as a hindrance, it may actually reduce the market share,” said McMahon.Read More: Decentralized Exchanges Beat Centralized Counterparts for On-Chain Flows: Chainalysis'Move-to-Earn' Application Stepn Suffers Cyber Attack After Upgrade Users were recommended to ""get some rest"" while Stepn worked to secure its servers and recover from the various attacks.Binance Labs Invests in DEX PancakeSwap; CAKE Jumps Nearly 10% Despite the rally, CAKE is still 36% below the $7.46 level from a month ago on the back of a challenging May for the crypto markets.Antsy Lithuania Latest to Anticipate EU Crypto Law With One of Its Own Ministers don’t want a crypto disaster to happen while they’re waiting for Brussels lawmakers to dot the i’s on landmark MiCA legislation, but some warn their plans could wreck the sector.The Intelligent Crypto Thesis AI and machine learning will usher in new forms of digital assets from intelligent NFTs to self-determining DeFi protocols.Bitcoin Might, in Fact, Be the Great ‘Equalizer’ A new global survey drills in on the perception of Bitcoin around the world, and the findings appear to be generally optimistic for global equity.Today’s newsletter was edited by Bradley Keoun and produced by Parikshit Mishra and Stephen Alpher.CORRECTION (June 6, 15:19 UTC): Changes date of CPI report to June 10.

Bitcoin has been ticking a little above and below this threshold since early May, depending on the day's events as investors nervously await clear signs about the direction of inflation and the global economy.""BTC remains weak until it conclusively breaches the $31k to $32k range,"" Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull, wrote to CoinDesk. ""However, we continue to see some buying below $30K that is keeping the price afloat.""Ether, the second largest crypto by market cap, was recently changing hands just above $1,800, up slightly over the same period and well within the range it's held over the last two two weeks under $2,000. Other major cryptos were about flat, although mostly on the green side with LINK and ADA among the biggest winners, rising 5% and 3%, respectively. Trading was light as is typical on most weekends.Cryptos' weekend holding pattern veered slightly away from equity indices, which closed down on Friday with the tech-focused Nasdaq plunging 2.4% and the S&P 500 falling 1.6%. Digital assets and stocks have correlated increasingly in recent months.On a more upbeat note, a better-than-expected U.S. jobs report on Friday, showing that nonfarm payrolls added about 390,000 jobs in May, suggested that the economy was far from ready to fold. Analysts have been concerned that the U.S. central bank's interest rate hikes will throw the U.S. economy into recession. And in a sliver of possible good news for crypto, shares of investor savant Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation ETF, which includes crypto exchange Coinbase, have risen over 15% since the second week in May. Wood's as been a noted Bitcoin advocate.Still, crypto traders remain bearish as evidenced by last week's downturn in the Fear & Greed Index. BitBull's DiPasquale sees a greater likelihood of Bitcoin tumbling from its current perch than breaking out. ""We are expecting some directional action in the coming week or so, as Bitcoin either breaks out of the current range or breaks down to look for a lower low,"" he wrote. ""Currently, the probability of a breakdown appears higher than a break upwards.""S&P 500: 4,108 -1.6%DJIA: 32,899 -1%Nasdaq: 12,012 -2.4%Gold: $1,852 +0.09%Another Challenging Week for StablecoinsFirst South Korea. Then Japan.Stablecoin protocols finished another bumpy week of increased regulation and scrutiny.The protocols that peg a digital asset to a fiat currency, commodity or a mathematical formula based on some group of assets have been on the defensive since the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin (UST) token in early May. Observers of stablecoins, which are supposed to be lower risk than other digital assets, anticipated the extra attention, particularly for algorithm-based stablecoins such as UST.On Friday, Japan's parliament passed a legal framework around stablecoins to protect investors, making the country one of the first first major economies to pass a stablecoin-specific law. The legislation, which goes into effect in a year, clarifies the definition of stablecoins as digital money that must be linked to the yen or another legal tender and guarantees holders the right to redeem them at face value. The bill does not address existing asset-backed or algorithmic stablecoins.Only licensed banks, registered money transfer agents and trust companies can now issue stablecoins, although Japanese exchanges do not list them.The law followed less than two weeks after a report in the Korea Times that South Korean financial authorities would introduce measures to hold crypto exchanges to greater scrutiny following the implosion of UST and the LUNA token behind it. A two-day National Assembly emergency seminar to discuss the debacle, which may have victimized about 280,000 South Koreans, considered the role of exchanges and law enforcement, among other topics.""We need to make exchanges play their proper role, and toward that end it is crucial for watchdogs to supervise them thoroughly,"" Rep. Sung Il-jong of the ruling People Power Party said. ""When exchanges violate rules, they should be held legally responsible to ensure that the market functions well without any troubles.""The country's Financial Services Commission plans to build close ties with law enforcers ""to monitor any illegal acts in the industry and protect investors' rights,"" said its vice chair, Kim So-young.Bitcoin Weighed Down by $34K Resistance, Support at $20K-$25KBitcoin (BTC) continues to face strong resistance at its 50-day moving average, which currently sits at $34,000.The cryptocurrency has been anchored to the $30,000 price level over the past two weeks, absorbing a majority of trading volume. That could point to volatile price moves later this month.On the daily chart, bitcoin's relative strength index (RSI) is stuck below the 50 neutral mark, which indicates slowing momentum behind the recent upswing in price. The persistent decline in momentum means BTC's six-month downtrend remains intact.The weekly RSI is the most oversold since March 2020, which preceded an uptrend in price. This time, however, upside appears to be limited because of negative long-term momentum signals.Still, over the short term, BTC could stabilize above the $20,000-$25,000 support zone. The 200-week moving average, currently at $22,179, is another gauge of long-term trend support.BTC is on watch for a countertrend bullish signal, per the DeMark indicators, which could appear over the next two weeks. That could pave the way for a short-term price bounce, which would delay additional breakdowns on the chart. Upside moves could be fleeting, however, with secondary support at $17,673 providing a more stable ground for capitulation.9 a.m. HKT/SGT(1 a.m. UTC): Australia TD inflation MoM/YoY (May)9:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(1:30 a.m. UTC): ANZ job advertisements9:45 a.m. HKT/SGT(1:40 a.m. UTC): China Caixin services PMI (May)In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:US Added 390K Jobs in May, but More Crypto Firms Announce Layoffs, DOJ’s First NFT Insider Trading CaseAli Pourdad of Quantfury joined ""First Mover"" to discuss the latest crypto market moves as bitcoin traded below $30,000 and the market downturn leads to crypto industry layoffs.

7,"Crypto market conditions deteriorated further on Saturday, with the broader market seeing red for a fifth consecutive day.Investor angst over the influence of inflation on Fed monetary policy weighed, with investors unable to move on from the US inflation numbers from Friday.The total crypto market cap saw another $39 billion wiped out, with the total market cap falling to a day low of $1,105 billion.After a bearish Friday session, the crypto market took another hit on Saturday. Investors continued to respond to the pick up in US inflationary pressure, with the Fed due to deliver its June policy decision on Wednesday.The extended sell-off left bitcoin (BTC) at sub-$29,000 for the day, with upbeat investor sentiment towards Chainlink (LINK) and Cardano (ADA) delivering little support.Saturday’s bearish session saw the total crypto market cap slide by $61 billion to a day low of $1,105 billion before support kicked in.For the crypto bulls, the only consolation was the avoidance of the May 12 low of $1,082 billion.Investor sentiment towards inflation, the economy, and Fed monetary policy remained the key drivers.For the crypto market, an anticipated shift in the regulatory landscape remained another factor for investors to consider.Of the top ten cryptos, ETH and SOL saw the heaviest losses, sliding by 7.89% and by 8.62%, respectively.Things were not much better elsewhere.ADA (-3.66%), BNB (-5.73%), BTC (-2.30%), DOGE (-7.33%), and XRP (-5.83%) all reacted further to Friday’s US inflation numbers.From the top 100, Chainlink (LINK) was among the worst performers for a second day, tumbling by 12.37%.Helium (HNT) led the way down, sliding by 16.71%, with GMT (-12.01), SAND (-10.05%), and AAVE (-12.43%) also among the heavy losers.Of the top 100, OKB (OKB) bucked the broader market trend, rising by 5.24%.Total liquidations spiked on Saturday as investors reacted further to the latest US inflation numbers.According to Coinglass, 24-hour liquidations stood at $352.15 million, up from $298.31 million on Friday. More significantly, liquidations over 12 hours stood at $194.63 million, leaving 24-hour liquidations at similar levels to Friday.1-hour liquidations suggested a steadying in market conditions.At the time of writing, total liquidations over one hour stood at $2.29 million.The EU made progress towards an agreement on MiCA, though differences remained, including how to oversee NFTs.Huobi launched a $1 billion investment vehicle targeting DeFi and Web3.TRON DAO Reserve bought $50 million in BTC and TRX to leave USDD overcollateralized by 194.84%.Ethereum core developers announced another delay, sinking ETH.Deloitte survey showed more than 75% of US merchants are planning to accept digital currencies within the next 24 months.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireTaiwan says it’s willing to engage with China, doesn’t want to close doorEthereum (ETH) Slides to $1,500 as Core Developers Announce DelaysBiden says federal government will fund New Mexico wildfire recoveryUkraine says it still controls Sievierodonetsk plant sheltering hundredsTunisia military prosecutors investigates journalist for ‘harming public order’Ukraine and Russia: What you need to know right nowAfter a week of announcements in NSW to improve the affordability of childcare and early learning, today Victorian parents are getting a turn.

Market reaction to US inflation figures weighed.This morning, however, XRP found early support, with investors now awaiting the Court ruling on the Hinman speech-related documents.Key technical indicators remain bearish. XRP sits below the 50-day EMA.On Friday, XRP slid by 4.65%. Following a 0.10% decline on Thursday, XRP ended the day at $0.3811. News updates from the ongoing SEC v Ripple case took a backseat, with investors responding to US inflation figures for May.A bullish start saw XRP strike a day high of $0.4112 before hitting reverse.XRP broke through the First Major Resistance Level at $0.4033 and the Second Major Resistance Level at $0.4070.Market reaction to US inflation figures, however, led XRP to a day low of $0.3761.The extended sell-off saw XRP fall through the day’s Major Support Levels to visit sub-$0.38 for the first time in June.Market angst over inflation had tested support ahead of Friday’s US inflation numbers, overshadowing news updates from the ongoing SEC v Ripple case.Going into the weekend, some minor court filings provided little distraction. Things could prove to be materially different next week, however.Last Tuesday, the SEC and Ripple attended a court-scheduled conference. The subject matter was the SEC’s position on William Hinman’s 2018 speech-related documents.The conference leaned in favor of the defense, with Judge Sarah Netburn grilling the SEC’s shifts in position vis-à-vis William Hinman’s famous speech. In 2018, the former SEC Director of the Division of Corporation Finance stated that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are not securities.Since August 2021, the SEC has filed at least six motions, claiming that Hinman’s speech falls under the attorney-client privilege. At one point, the SEC had taken the view that Hinman’s comments were his own.The consensus is that the speech-related documents contain material damaging to the SEC case. A ruling in favor of Ripple could expedite a settlement and drive XRP back towards $1.00.At the time of writing, XRP was up 0.34% to $0.3824.A bullish start to the day saw XRP rise to a morning high of $0.3881 before sliding to a low of $0.3797.XRP left the Major Support and Resistance Levels untested through the morning session.XRP will need to move through the $0.3895 pivot to target the First Major Resistance Level at $0.4028. XRP would need the broader crypto market support to return to $0.40 levels.In a broad-based crypto rally, XRP should test the Second Major Resistance Level at $0.4246 and resistance at $0.4250. The Third Major Resistance Level sits at $0.4597.Failure to move through the pivot would bring the First Major Support Level at $0.3677 in play.Barring another extended sell-off throughout the day, XRP should avoid sub-$0.36. The Second Major Support Level sits at $0.3544.The EMAs and the 4-hourly candlestick chart (below) send a bearish signal. At the time of writing, XRP sits below the 50-day EMA, currently at $0.3959. Today, the 50-day EMA fell back from the 100-day EMA. The 100-day EMA eased back from the 200-day EMA, XRP price negative.A move through the 100-day EMA to $0.4041 would support a run at the 200-day EMA and $0.45.

Solana’s SOL fell 6%, ether (ETH) lost 2.3% and XRP fell 0.8%.Overall, crypto market capitalization dropped by 2.3% to $1.28 trillion, continuing a slide from a capitalization of over $2.2 trillion in March.The fall in crypto prices came ahead of the release of the CPI report scheduled for 8:30 a.m. ET Friday. Economists expect inflation in May to rise over 0.7% from April, meaning an 8.3% rise since May of last year, according to CNBC.Inflation concerns have contributed to bitcoin’s fall in the past several weeks. In May, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates by the largest amount since 2000 as it seeks to tighten monetary policy following $2 trillion in stimulus in the past few years. The Fed's tightening has caused a drop in global stocks, which carried over to losses in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.Earlier in April, Goldman Sachs (GS) analysts said in a note that the Fed's aggressive measures to control inflation could result in a recession, which added to investor concerns.While bitcoin has closely followed the price movements of risky technology stocks in the past few months, some market observers remain upbeat about the long-term growth of cryptocurrencies.“Generally, the correlation gap between cryptocurrencies and stock markets is long-term good news as it attracts the attention of professional investors,” Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior market analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email.“Weakness in equity and bond markets, sagging gold and the murky outlook for the real estate market are turning to cryptocurrencies as another tool in a diversified portfolio,” he added.After a week of announcements in NSW to improve the affordability of childcare and early learning, today Victorian parents are getting a turn.

Investors and developers will, therefore, be watching the progress on Capitol Hill.SEC Chair Gary Gensler may not give in too easily in allowing the CFTC to oversee the digital asset space.In May, SEC Chair Gary Gensler talked of the need for comprehensive rules for digital assets.Speaking at the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Annual Meeting, Gensler stated that most cryptocurrencies are securities.Gensler reportedly said,“Most crypto tokens involve a group of entrepreneurs raising money from the public in anticipation of profits – the hallmark of an investment contract or a security under our jurisdiction. Most crypto tokens are investment contracts under the Supreme Court’s Howey Test.”This year, via letter, lawmakers questioned the SEC’s targeted approach towards crypto firms and raised concerns over how the SEC approach could impact innovation. As with The Responsible Financial Innovation Act, the letter was bipartisan. Members from both sides of the Aisle co-signed the letter.With the CFTC and the SEC looking to regulate the digital asset space, it will likely boil down to the final version and passage of The Responsible Financial Innovation Act.We can certainly expect some political wrangling in the corridors of power. Both regulators may consider the oversight of the digital asset space as the golden egg.The crypto market will reflect its preference in the months ahead, with price action to closely reflect the bill’s passage.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireUkraine say Russia looks for weak points in Ukrainian defences near key riverHistory of Japan’s intervention in currency marketsChina’s May new bank loans surge 1.89 trln yuan, much stronger than forecastsRussian central bank to study legality of banks’ plans for fees on FX accountsAustralia’s longest-running soap Neighbours calls it a wrapShanghai to lock down millions again for mass COVID testingThe S&P; 500 has rallied to snap a five-session losing skid after a policy announcement by the Federal Reserve that raised interest rates to market expectations as the US central bank seeks to fight rising inflation without sparking a recession.The Federal Reserve raised its target interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point - its biggest rate hike since 1994 - and projected a slowing economy and rising unemployment in the months to come.While variable rates are currently being lifted, fixed-rate holders have been warned they are not immune to interest rate hikes.

Both the CFTC and the SEC have been vocal, as the SEC v Ripple (XRP) case drags on.For some jurisdictions, began work on introducing a more robust crypto regulatory framework sooner than in others.In the US, the Biden Administration put cryptos front and center with the release of the White House Executive Order in March.While the Executive Order was silent on which authority should regulate the crypto sector, the administration identified the need for lawmakers to deliver a regulatory framework.This week, senators from both sides of the aisle introduced a bill looking to address the very issues that the crypto industry faces within the US.In March, Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand announced that lawmakers are working on a “broad-based regulatory framework for how this industry should potentially be regulated in the future.”At that time, Gillibrand reportedly said,“Some parts will be regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, some parts will be regulated under the Securities and Exchange Commission.”This week, news hit the wires of US lawmakers aiming to put the oversight of cryptos and other digital assets into the hands of the CFTC.US senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand filed the Responsible Financial Innovation Act. The bill would give digital asset oversight powers to the CFTC.While crypto companies side with the CFTC, lawmakers remain undecided. Indecision leaves the digital asset space in a regulatory black hole.For the digital asset space that encompasses crypto and NFTs, a resolution to the classification of cryptos and NFTs would be a step in the right direction.At present, the Securities and Exchange Commission is embroiled in a lengthy legal battle with Ripple Labs over the sale of XRP, claiming that XRP are securities and not commodities.For Ripple Lab and XRP, the passing of a bill may come too late. It remains to be seen, however, whether the outcome of the SEC v Ripple case has any influence.A Ripple victory, either by way of settlement or in court, would put the CFTC on a stronger footing.Regulatory uncertainty continues to weigh on the crypto market. Progress towards handing the reins to the CFTC should be crypto market positive.The crypto majors have shown little reaction, however, with the bill in its early stage of passage.At the time of writing, XRP was down 0.32% to $0.3988.A mixed morning saw XRP rise to an early high of $0.4014 before falling to a low of $0.3968.XRP will need to move through the $0.4016 pivot to target the First Major Resistance Level at $0.4084. XRP would need the broader crypto market to support a return to $0.40.In a broad-based crypto rebound, XRP should test the Second Major Resistance Level at $0.4168 and resistance at $0.42.Failure to move through the pivot would bring the First Major Support Level at $0.3932 into play.Barring an extended sell-off throughout the day, XRP should avoid the Second Major Support Level at $0.3864.The EMAs and the 4-hourly candlestick chart (below) send a bearish signal. At the time of writing, XRP sits below the 50-day EMA, currently at $0.3990. Today, the 50-day EMA flattened on the 100-day EMA.

XRP sits below the 100-day EMA.On Tuesday, XRP rose by 1.22%. Following a 1.87% gain on Monday, XRP ended the day at $0.4025. The upside came as investors turned their attention to the SEC-Ripple conference.A choppy session saw XRP slide to an early morning low of $0.3839 before finding support.XRP fell through the First Major Support Level at $0.3946 and the Second Major Support Level at $0.3868.The rebound saw XRP break back through the Major Support Levels and through the First Major Resistance Level at $0.4096 to strike a day high of $0.4167.Coming up against the Second Major Resistance Level at $0.4168, XRP fell back to end the day at sub-$0.41.While movement throughout the day tracked the broader crypto market, there was also plenty of interest in the court-scheduled SEC-Ripple conference to discuss the William Hinman speech-related documents and SEC claims that the documents fall under the attorney-client privilege.Attorney John Deaton discussed the conference on YouTube late on Tuesday.On Tuesday, attorney John Deaton delivered interested parties a summary of the SEC-Ripple conference.Deaton highlighted comments and a series of questions posed by Judge Sarah Netburn during the conference. These included,Help me understand what advice Hinman received?For what was he seeking advice?Do you stand by the position last year that the speech was his personal opinion?The SEC has distanced itself from that speech as his personal opinion.John Deaton, who attended the conference in New York, made some observations, which included,When the SEC has to turn over the documents, the SEC will settle.Judge Netburn knows that the SEC will appeal any unfavorable ruling to Judge Torres.SEC used a junior lawyer to represent at the conference, suggesting the SEC knows they have a losing a hand.Court decision likely by the end of next week with a ruling likely in favor of Ripple.A settlement would remove the chances of an appeal and provide certainty.The only way the SEC will settle is if the court rules in favor of Ripple vis-à-vis the Hinman speech-related docs.Assuming there is no settlement, the summary judgments are all due by November, with the court decision likely in March.Loomis Bill could usurp the case, but the bill will need to be signed by the president, making it more likely that a settlement or a court ruling will come first.Fair notice defense would mean that Ripple won’t have to pay the fine, but XRP will be a security. Such an outcome would leave XRP holders stranded.By way of background, John Deaton is counsel for the amici curiae, representing over 67,000 XRP holders in the SEC v Ripple case.At the time of writing, XRP was down 1.96% to $0.3994.A mixed morning saw XRP rise to an early high of $0.4099 before falling to a low of $0.3947.XRP will need to move through the $0.4027 pivot to target the First Major Resistance Level at $0.4214. XRP would need the broader crypto market support to break out from the morning high of $0.4099.In a broad-based crypto rebound, XRP should test resistance at $0.43. The Second Major Resistance Level sits at $0.4355.Failure to move back through the pivot would bring the First Major Support Level at $0.3886 back into play.Barring an extended sell-off throughout the day, XRP should avoid sub-$0.3850.

The fund has already deployed capital to two undisclosed projects.Moonbeam launched in January and currently has 100 projects that are either live or preparing to launch. In the first five months, Moonbeam users completed over 6.5 million transactions, and developers deployed over 5,000 smart contracts, according to the network.As an Ethereum-compatible parachain, Moonbeam allows for secure cross-chain interoperability without using bridges. Developers can build native multichain decentralized applications (dapps) and easily port existing smart contracts across blockchains.Arrington Capital participated in a $1.4 million funding round for Moonbeam in 2020 and a $6 million strategic capital raise last year.“Moonbeam has gained significant momentum as a new Layer 1 protocol and provides a needed spark for the larger multichain movement, a trend which we are seeing across our portfolio,” Arrington Capital co-founder and partner Michael Arrington said in the press release.Arrington, the founder of TechCrunch and CrunchBase, along with TechCrunch CEO Heather Harde, founded Arrington Capital in 2017. The venture capital firm also offers the flagship Arrington XRP Capital fund and the $100 million Arrington Algorand Growth Fund.Last month, the company scrubbed a new $100 million fund from its website that was tied to the Terra yield-generating protocol Anchor, which took major losses due to the crisis-stricken USD stablecoin. Arrington told CoinDesk the removal was due to decreased demand.Read more: Polkadot’s Moonbeam Adds Liquid Staking Giant LidoCompanies have been competing fiercely for skilled workers due to widespread labour shortages.

The conference will focus on the SEC’s claims that all William Hinman’s speech-related documents fall under the attorney-client privilege.In 2018, William Hinman, former SEC Director of Corporation Finance, said that bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are not securities.The speech became a bone of contention since the Ripple defense team filed a motion to compel in August 2021. Until now, Ripple Lab’s attorneys have failed to obtain documents related to the 2018 speech, despite court rulings in favor of Ripple Lab.In May, the courts permitted the SEC to submit the additional brief claiming that all documents related to Hinman’s speech fall under the attorney-client privilege.Since the submission, both Ripple and the SEC have responded further to the brief. This sequence of events has led to today’s conference, which could prove pivotal to the direction of the case.Interested parties may dial into the conference, commencing at 3 pm EST. As previously shared, the dial-in details are,USA 877-226-8215 INT 409-207-6982 Code 4713826#.(Calling in too early will give you a wrong code message).While the call is overnight for Asia and Europe, we can expect plenty of XRP price sensitivity to news updates from the conference.The very fact that the SEC has, according to Ripple defense attorney Matthew Solomon, filed at least six motions opposing the Defendant’ August 10, 2021 motion to compel suggests that the content may favor Ripple’s defense.At the time of writing, XRP was down 3.03% to $0.3903.A particularly bearish start to the day saw XRP slide to an early morning low of $0.3839 before finding support.The extended sell-off saw XRP slide through the First Major Support Level at $0.3946. XRP also fell through the Second Major Support Level at $0.3868 before a partial recovery to $0.39 levels.XRP will need to move through the First Major Support Level and the $0.4018 pivot to target the First Major Resistance Level at $0.4096. XRP would need the broader crypto market support to break out from the morning high of $0.4026.In the event of a broad-based crypto rebound, XRP should test the Second Major Resistance Level at $0.4168 and resistance at $0.42. The Third Major Resistance Level sits at $0.4318.Failure to move back through the First Major Support Level and the pivot would bring the Second Major Support Level at $0.3868 back into play.Barring an extended sell-off throughout the day, XRP should avoid sub-$0.38. The Third Major Support Level sits at $0.3718.The EMAs and the 4-hourly candlestick chart (below) send a bearish signal. At the time of writing, XRP sits below the 50-day EMA, currently at $0.3980. This morning, the 50-day EMA pulled back from the 100-day EMA. The 100-day EMA fell back from the 200-day EMA, XRP negative.A move through the 100-day EMA, currently at $0.4093, would support a run at $0.45.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireRussian superyacht in Fiji leaves for U.S. amid legal wranglingOil up 1%, supplies seen tighter as China relaxes COVID-19 curbsGold Price Prediction – Gold Rebound on Dollar WeaknessCasino gets 3 preliminary offers for GreenYellow energy business – sourcesRussia softens capital controls to allow companies to transfer forex overseasRussian attack destroys warehouses of major Ukrainian commodity terminal, company saysThe total value of Australia's property market is now five times bigger than Australia’s GDP.

BNB also fell through the First Major Support Level at $295 and the Second Major Support Level at $291 before returning to $293 levels.News of the SEC investigating the world’s leading exchange Binance sent BNB into the deep red.On Monday, Bloomberg reported on the “SEC investigating whether BNB was a security when sold in 2017.”According to the Bloomberg report,“US regulators are investigating whether Binance Holdings Ltd. broke securities rules by selling digital tokens just as the crypto exchange was getting off the ground five years ago.”The report went on to say,“The Securities and Exchange Commission’s review pries into the firm’s origins and those of BNB token, which is now the world’s fifth biggest. Investigators are examining if the 2017 initial coin offering amounted to the sale of a security that should have been registered with the agency.”Binance reportedly responded by saying,“It would not be appropriate for us to comment on our ongoing conversation with regulators, which include education, assistance, and voluntary responses to information requests.”Binance added,“We will continue to meet all requirements set by regulators.”Today’s news has yet to have a similar impact on BNB as with XRP, which slumped by more than 70% on news of the SEC filing a complaint against Ripple Labs in 2020.At the time of writing, BNB was down 1.85% to $293.16.BNB will need to move through the First Major Support Level at $295 and the $299 pivot to retarget the First Major Resistance Level at $303.BNB would need broader crypto market support to return to $300 levels.Failure to move through the First Major Support Level and the pivot would bring the Second Major Support Level at $291 back into play. Barring another extended sell-off, BNB should avoid the day low of $287.24. The Third Major Support Level sits at $283.Looking at the EMAs and the 4-hourly candlestick chart (above), it is a bearish signal. BNB sits below the 50-day EMA, currently at $304. This afternoon, the 50-day EMA pulled back from the 100-day EMA. The 100-day EMA fell back from the 200-day EMA; BNB price negative.Failure to move back through the 50-day EMA will leave BNB under pressure and bring sub-$285 into play.

Overall, crypto funds netted some $100 million in inflows, meaning that new money allocated to bitcoin funds compensated for the losses of non-bitcoin funds, or alternative cryptos (altcoins).The outperformance is a sign that ""investors are flocking to the relative safety of bitcoin,"" according to James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares.Some investors have reduced their exposure to risky assets, including cryptocurrencies, as financial markets adjust to persistently high inflation, interest-rate hikes by central banks around the globe and growing recession fears. Digital-asset investors see bitcoin, as the cryptocurrency with the longest history and largest market capitalization, as less risky than most other tokens. Bitcoin's ""dominance"" – its share of the overall industry market capitalization of – has climbed higher this year.BTC traded range-bound between $29,000 and $32,000 last week and was changing hands at $31,259 at press time.Ethereum funds continued their negative streak, marking nine consecutive weeks of outflows. Investors pulled out $32 million from funds that manage the second-largest cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), adding up to $357 million in outflows year to date. The outflows picked up in December 2021, and they represent a relatively small share (7%) of the total value of assets under management, the report added.Short-bitcoin funds, which intend to profit from bitcoin's price going lower, saw $1.3 million in inflows.Multiasset funds, which manage more than one cryptocurrency, netted $4.3 million in inflows, bringing total inflows up to $201 million since the start of the year, underlining investor demand for diversification.Funds that manage cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin or ether didn't move significantly. Funds that manage solana (SOL) and XRP saw minimal inflows ($0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively).The regional breakdown shows that last week's flows predominantly came from the Americas with $88 million last week. In comparison, funds listed in Europe saw just $11 million in inflows last week, continuing a trend where ""European investors have been much more bearish this year so far,"" the report added.After a week of announcements in NSW to improve the affordability of childcare and early learning, today Victorian parents are getting a turn.

XRP sits below the 100-day EMA.It is a big week for Ripple and XRP. Last week, Judge Sarah Netburn announced a June 7 conference in response to a May 18 SEC filing that responded to a Ripple reply dated May 13.The May 13 reply was in response to an SEC brief claiming that the attorney-client privilege protects documents related to William Hinman’s speech in 2018.The SEC v Ripple case has taken center stage this year, with former SEC Director of Corporation Finance the focal point.On June 3, defense attorney James Filan shared a post detailing the dial-in details for the June 7 SEC v Ripple conference.The conference is due to take place at 3 pm EST. As per the tweet, the dial-in details are,“USA 877-226-8215 INT 409-207-6982 Code 4713826#.”The tweet went on to say,“Stay tuned to @FilanLaw for any changes. Calling in too early will give you a wrong code message.”The outcome of the conference could prove material in the SEC v Ripple case and for the broader crypto market.In 2018, Hinman said that bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are not securities.By way of background, Ripple Labs filed a motion to compel in August 2021. The motion requested that the SEC provide all the speech-related documents.Since the August motion, Ripple defense lawyer Matthew Solomon objected to the SEC brief, highlighting that the SEC has filed at least six motions to contest Ripple’s motion to compel.A ruling in favor of the defense would furnish Ripple Labs with internal discussions on the classification of bitcoin, Ethereum, and possibly other cryptos.Following numerous SEC filings on the matter of the attorney-client privilege, it remains to be seen whether Judge Netburn leaves the door open for further filings.We expect plenty of XRP sensitivity to the outcome of Tuesday’s conference.At the time of writing, XRP was up 1.82% to $0.4023.A bullish start to the day saw XRP strike an early morning high of $0.4033.XRP broke through the First Major Resistance Level at $0.3998.XRP will need to avoid the First Major Resistance Level and the $0.3946 pivot to retarget the Second Major Resistance Level at $0.4046. XRP would need the broader crypto market to avoid a return to sub-$0.40.In the event of an extended rally, XRP should test the resistance at $0.41. The Third Major Resistance Level sits at $0.4146.A fall through the First Major Resistance Level and the pivot would bring the First Major Support Level at $0.3898 into play.Barring another extended sell-off throughout the day, XRP should avoid sub-$0.3850. The Second Major Support Level sits at $0.3846.The EMAs and the 4-hourly candlestick chart (below) send a bearish signal. At the time of writing, XRP sits below the 100-day EMA, currently at $0.4102. This morning, the 50-day EMA narrowed to the 100-day EMA. The 100-day EMA flattened on the 200-day EMA, XRP positive.A move through the 100-day EMA would support a run at $0.45.

Bitcoin (BTC) managed to avoid red, however, to end a nine-week losing streak.Another bearish start to the day saw bitcoin and the broader market face another day in the red before afternoon support kicked in.Concerns over Fed monetary policy, following Friday’s US nonfarm payrolls, continued to weigh on investor appetite.It was a mixed Sunday session for the crypto market, with lawmaker chatter from the US testing investor resilience over the weekend.In recent days, a number of lawmakers targeted cryptos, highlighting the risks and calling for increased oversight.The collapse of TerraUSD (UST) and Terra LUNA has given lawmakers cause to put the spotlight on the crypto market.Crypto winter chatter and talk of exchanges laying off employees or freezing headcounts continued to add to the negative mood.For bitcoin (BTC), five sessions in the green from seven, which included a 7.69% rally on Monday, ended a nine-week losing streak.On Sunday, the total crypto market cap fell to a day low of $1,196 billion before ending the day at $1,214 billion.A fall to sub-$2,000 billion for a third consecutive session continued to reflect the bearish sentiment across the market.For the crypto bulls, steering well clear of the May 12 current year low of $1,082 billion will remain the key.BTC rose by 0.18% on Sunday. Following a 0.56% gain on Saturday, BTC ended the week up by 1.51% to $29,898.Across the rest of the top ten, ADA (+0.18%), ETH (+0.07%), and XRP (+0.77%) joined BTC in positive territory.BNB (-0.76%), Dogecoin (DOGE) (-1.03%), and SOL (-1.28%) ended the day in the red, however.For the week, divergence across the top ten was evident. ADA was the success story, rallying by 22.0%, while SOL slid by 11.9%.Market conditions were benign relative to mid-week. According to Coinglass, 24-hour liquidations stood at $81.52 million. While up from levels seen on Saturday, liquidations remained well below $500 million levels seen mid-week.1-hour and 4-hour liquidations suggest an easing in selling pressure, which supported the bitcoin recovery from early losses.At the time of writing, total liquidations over one hour stood at $2.62 million.The markets will likely continue to keep an eye on liquidations, with any spike a test of support.Luna 2 ended the week up by 23.4% but remained down 40.3% from an opening price of $10.69.STEPN (GMT) announced that it was under multiple DDOS attacks on Sunday, leaving GMT down 6.2% on the day.The Tron Foundation delivered stablecoin transparency via the ‘Tron DAO Reserve’ page to allay fears following the collapse of TerraUSD.Over the weekend, Bored Ape Yacht Club announced a discord server exploit, impacting 200 ETH worth of NFTs.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireKim Dotcom Predicts ‘Great Economic Reset’, Is Crypto a Solution?UK says Russia struck rail infrastructure in KyivThai economy still seen growing 3% this year – Finance MinisterSaudi Arabia hikes July crude prices surprisingly high for Asia buyersMexican president’s party set to win most states in Sunday electionsExclusive-Biden to waive tariffs for 24 mths on solar panels hit by probe -sourcesAfter a week of announcements in NSW to improve the affordability of childcare and early learning, today Victorian parents are getting a turn.

Here’s how far it expects the market to drop.","It was a bullish Saturday for bitcoin (BTC) and the broader market though the gains were modest.The market had started the day in a bearish fashion before finding afternoon support to wrap up the day in positive territory.Concerns over Fed monetary policy, following Friday’s US nonfarm payrolls, pegged the majors back from a full recovery of Friday’s losses.It was a relatively bullish Saturday session for the crypto market, with the top ten partially recovering Friday’s heavy losses.The news wires tested support early in the session, with anti-crypto chatter testing investor sentiment.Over the weekend, the FTC reported on crypto cybercrime numbers that could give regulators greater incentive to clamp down on the crypto market to protect investors.Crypto winter chatter and talk of exchanges laying off employees or freezing headcounts added to the negative mood.For bitcoin (BTC), it was the sixth gain from eight sessions, though resistance at $30,000 left bitcoin at sub-$30,000.On Saturday, the total crypto market cap slipped to a day low of $1,190 billion before the afternoon recovery.The fall back to sub-$1,200 billion for a second consecutive day suggests continued volatility.For the crypto bulls, steering well clear of the May 12 current year low of $1,082 billion will be the key.Looking at the crypto top ten, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana (SOL) led the way with gains of 2.06% and 1.99%, respectively.ADA (+1.07%), BNB (+0.97% ), BTC (+0.56%), ETH (+1.70%), and XRP (+0.66%) also found support.From the top 100, The Graph (GRT) and Helium (HNT) led the pack, rallying by 11.6% and by 12.6%, respectively.Both benefitted from a shift in sentiment on the day and are set for a week of solid gains. GRT is currently up 16.2% for the week, with HNT up an impressive 28.7%.Having spiked at $500 million levels in the week, 24-hour total liquidations stood at just $55.82 million, according to Coinglass.Over 1-year, total liquidations reflected a further easing in selling pressure, with liquidations standing at $0.961 million.A pickup in total liquidations through the early part of the day could test investor sentiment, however.The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported consumers losing more than $1 billion in crypto scams since 2021.New York Proof-of-Work mining bill, Assembly Bill A7389C, is on the way to New York Governor Kathy Hochul for consideration.Fed Governor Christopher J.

11,"Don't miss CoinDesk's Consensus 2022, the must-attend crypto & blockchain festival experience of the year in Austin, TX this June 9-12.Crypto markets lost some 12% in the past 24 hours amid a weak macroeconomic sentiment and systemic risk from within to reach market capitalization levels last seen in January 2021.Bitcoin (BTC) slid 13% to under $25,000, its lowest in 18 months while ether (ETH) lost 18%. Dogecoin (DOGE) fell some 21%, and Solana’s SOL, Polkadot’s DOT, and XRP fell at least 16% in the past 24 hours.The top hundred cryptocurrencies by market capitalization recorded average losses of 15%, data shows. Despite the drop, crypto futures only recorded $1 billion in liquidations – a relatively low figure compared with previously high liquidations when prices did not move as much. This suggests that the plunge was led by spot selling.Weakness in cryptocurrencies came amid poor U.S. Consumer Price Index data for May released last week.Inflation surged to 8.3% over the past year, the report said, causing traders to price in further rate hikes of more than 175 basis points by September, implying two half-point and one 75 basis-point hike, as per Bloomberg.Such analysis led to a rout in global assets on Monday, with Asian stock indices ending the day 3.39% lower. Europe’s Stoxx 600 fell 2.2% since Monday’s start, and Germany’s DAX lost 2.18%. Futures in the U.S. opened lower. Technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 sunk 2.95% since Monday’s open, while S&P500 fell 2.33%.Traders said they expect crypto prices to continue to fall until market conditions improve.“We could be facing even more severe losses moving forward. Economic growth is clearly slowing, and reports already suggest the U.S. could see a recession in the next year,” said Manuel Ortiz-Olave, co-founder at equity tokens firm Brickken, in an email to CoinDesk. “Higher inflation will continue forcing higher interest rates, and higher interest rates are also negative for economic growth.”""Some of the most important companies in the world like Apple [AAPL], Microsoft [MSFT] or Nike [NKE] have already reported slowdowns in sales, and Tesla [TSLA] has indicated that layoffs will come soon. These are clearly negative headlines, which combined with higher food and fuel prices, make people be careful about their savings,” Ortiz-Olave said, explaining that a slowdown in consumer spending would lead to a loss of revenue for major companies.Meanwhile, possible systemic risk from within the crypto space contributed to the falling sentiment as crypto-lender Celsius paused withdrawals.The company allows users to earn yields of more than 17% on their crypto holdings and cited “extreme market conditions” as one of the factors behind its decision. This led to severe criticism among market observers on Crypto Twitter.Elsewhere, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) dedicated to the Tron ecosystem deployed $2 billion in funding to protect against a possible fall in the prices of its TRX tokens.“Funding rate of shorting #TRX on binance is negative 500% APR. Trondaoreserve will deploy 2 billion USD to fight them,” Tron founder Justin Sun tweeted. “Short squeeze is coming.”Monday’s drop seemed to stabilize with bitcoin trading at just about the $24,100 mark at writing time.With the “breakdown,” we should re-assess and adjust the Elliott Wave Principle (EWP)-based target zone.The S&P; 500 has rallied to snap a five-session losing skid after a policy announcement by the Federal Reserve that raised interest rates to market expectations as the US central bank seeks to fight rising inflation without sparking a recession.The Federal Reserve raised its target interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point - its biggest rate hike since 1994 - and projected a slowing economy and rising unemployment in the months to come.After a week of announcements in NSW to improve the affordability of childcare and early learning, today Victorian parents are getting a turn.

Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands just below the $1,800 level, about where it was perched a day ago and for the past few weeks. Other major altcoins were mixed, with LTC off more than 3% at one point and ADA and CRO down about a percentage point. Among the winners, LINK continued its recent surge, rising over 6% at one point, while SOL was up more than 3%.""Bitcoin continues to hover around the $30,000 level as crypto traders await a key inflation report that could sway market expectations as to what the Fed may do in September,"" Oanda Senior Analyst Americas Edward Moya wrote in an email.The European Central Bank's (ECB) announcement that it would begin raising interest rates next month sent first major European and then U.S. indexes falling with the latter taking a last-hour dive to post their biggest decline since mid May. Technology companies suffered among the roughest batterings, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropping 2.7% and the tech component of the S&P 500 off about the same. The ECB announced it would hike rates a quarter of a point in July to combat inflation and that it would raise rates additionally later in the year.The U.S. CPI is widely expected to show inflation still percolating well above 8%, its highest level in four decades. The U.S. Central Bank will likely raise interest rates another half-percentage point at its next meeting to match its most recent rate hike last month. Meanwhile energy prices continued to hover around 2022 highs with Brent crude oil, a benchmark of global energy markets, closing at about $123 per barrel, a roughly 60% increase from the start of the year.""Inflation is hot and it will remain hot and rate hike expectations should continue to climb after each monthly inflation report,"" Moya wrote.Cryptos suffered their own latest, mini-outbreak of bad news with separate reports that South Korean authorities are investigating TerraForm Labs for the collapse of its terraUSD stablecoin (UST), and that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was probing whether the Singapore-registered firm had violated U.S. laws in its marketing of UST and the LUNA token that supported it.""This has been a messy several weeks for crypto filled with lawsuits, scams, and fading interest as prices have remained anchored,"" Moya wrote. ""Crypto needs a few fresh catalysts to break out of these doldrums and that could take a while.""S&P 500: 4,017 -2.3%DJIA: 32,272 -1.9%Nasdaq: 11,754 -2.7%Gold: $1,847 -0.2%Analyst Opinion Differs on the Ethereum Ropsten MergeEthereum’s Ropsten public testnet underwent a “Merge” on Wednesday ahead of an eventual rollout on the main network. The move comes ahead of a much-awaited shift from the current proof-of-work (PoW) network to a proof-of-stake (PoS) design.PoW refers to a validation model that relies on entities called miners that use computing resources to validate transactions and support a blockchain network. PoS, on the other hand, relies on network ""validators"" who lock up relevant tokens on nodes to process transactions and support the network.PoS systems are considered more environmentally friendly than PoW and help create a cheaper and faster blockchain. A move to PoS would alleviate recurrent criticisms of Ethereum’s network, such as the network’s fees. Fees, for example, crossed over $12,000 worth of ether (ETH) per transaction earlier this year when non-fungible tokens (NFT) related to the popular Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem were offered to the public.Switching the blockchain from one consensus mechanism to another is a complex change, which requires multiple tests on testnets like Ropsten before they are finally deployed on the mainnet.Currently, the Beacon Chain is the PoS coordination chain that already has validators creating and validating new blocks in tandem with the main PoW execution chain. Once the PoS chain has been adequately tested and secured, the two chains will merge and Ethereum will continue as a PoS blockchain.A shift to PoS will cause a shift in ether’s market dynamics. Supply would likely decline as fewer coins would likely be issued, while expected yields of over 7% to stakers would increase demand for ether.Such forecasts have led to positive sentiment among investors, with some, like prominent billionaire technology investor Mark Cuban, stating they are “very bullish” on the asset’s future.Market observers and developers within the crypto space remain mixed in reaction, however.Brad Yasar, the founder of decentralized finance (DeFi) platform EQIFI, said in an email that while a shift to PoS comes with benefits, Ethereum’s PoW model was its main feature thus far.“As much as a transition from POW to POS is seen as the next step in Ethereum's future and is expected to solve several main challenges the blockchain is facing, it is important to note that PoW was Ethereum's DNA,” Yasar said. “Newer blockchains that copied Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and changed the validation mechanism or block structures or fees have launched since then, yet none has been able to take over Ethereum.”Yasar stated ether’s recent price drop was partly due to “the uncertainty among the community that has been supporting Ethereum by mining on it.”“Miners are an important segment of any PoW blockchain community that Ethereum will alienate once it is goes PoS. The long-term impact of this change can be a significant one as many supporters of Ethereum are going to leave [the blockchain] for other opportunities,” Yasar explained.“All the benefits of lower carbon footprint, lower fees, etc., may not be enough to keep Ethereum relevant in a post-PoW world,” he added.Others, however, remain upbeat about the Merge’s prospects, especially considering the significantly lessening of the environmental impact.“We should not underestimate how important Ethereum’s switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake will be,” said Choise.com director of strategy Austin Kimm in a Telegram message. “This is just a test, but it at least means that Ethereum is on track to do what it promised.”“Billions of complicated processing calculations will no longer be required and it is expected that this will reduce the energy consumption to negligible levels. Multiply this across literally thousands of tokens created on Ethereum and this should be a major milestone in global crypto adoption,” Kimm said, adding his firm remains “very bullish about the future of Ethereum.”Estimates for a full rollout to PoS on the mainnet are in the final quarter of this year. A few features, such as the ability to withdraw staked ETH, however, will have to wait until after the Merge is complete, as previously reported.Once Ethereum shifts from PoW to PoS, validators who have staked the required 32 ETH will take over the role of adding new blocks to the blockchain.Editor's Note: Technician's Take is on hiatus today.Consensus 2022 by CoinDeskRelease of U.S. Consumer Price Index9:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(1:30 a.m. UTC): China consumer price index (MoM/YoY/May)In case you missed it, CoinDesk TV is covering the Consensus conference:Creativity Reimagined: Web 3 and the New Creative CanvasWeb 3 is unlocking a creative renaissance, giving artists new tools to express their intent, and demanding new skill sets to succeed.

For now, sentiment among crypto traders is still bearish, albeit less so compared with last week, according to the bitcoin Fear & Greed index.Meanwhile, most alternative cryptos (altcoins) outperformed bitcoin on Thursday, indicating a greater appetite for risk among short-term traders. Typically, alts rise more than BTC during up markets because of their greater risk profile. And the opposite is true during down markets.Two standouts on Thursday were Chainlink's LINK token and Helium's HNT token, which both rallied by as much as 10% over the past 24 hours. And over the past week, Cardano's ADA token rose by 9%, compared with BTC's flat performance over the same period.●Bitcoin (BTC): $30,038, −0.31%●Ether (ETH): $1,784, −0.18%●S&P 500 daily close: 4,019, −2.36%●Gold: $1,850 per troy ounce, −0.13%●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.04%Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.Bitcoin's funding rate, or the cost of funding long and short positions in the perpetual futures market, has been at or around neutral levels over the past six months. The previous record duration of a compressed funding environment lasted for four months from May to October last year.""This consistency of neutral to negative funding rates is unprecedented in the BTC [perpetual market] history,"" Arcane Research wrote in a report this week. That could be driven by the prolonged bearish sentiment among crypto traders, or the entrance of more funds taking advantage of the base neutral funding rate of 0.01% to earn a consistent yield, according to Arcane.Typically, funding rates have seen sharp swings, which reflected extreme bullish/bearish sentiment around price highs and lows. Over time, however, traders have been less willing to pay for additional long or short exposure, possibly indicating a lower appetite for leverage or a neutral outlook among market participants.Currently, funding rates are making minor lows, which could signal stabilization in prices after extreme sell-offs. For example, BTC's dip last weekend sent Bybit’s funding rate to the lowest level since February, similar to what occurred after BTC's sharp drop toward $25,300 on May 10.SEC investigating company behind terraUSD: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is looking into whether Terraform Labs – the Singapore-registered firm that created the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin and luna token – violated U.S. laws regarding how it marketed the crypto coins.

Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands at about $1,800, about flat over the same period. Most other major cryptos spent much of their day in the red with DOT and AVAX recently down over 3% and SOL declining more than 2%. LINK was among the winners, rising approximately 2%.Crypto prices, which have largely correlated to stocks, dovetailed again with major indices. The S&P 500 fell about 1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and tech heavy Nasdaq declined a little bit less as investors continued their watchful waiting for clearer indications on the direction of inflation and the economy.This week's signs have been decidedly negative with the World Bank cutting its forecast for economic growth this year from 4.1% to 2.9% amid fears of stagflation – a toxic combination of slowing growth and rising prices – pessimistic inflationary comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen at a Senate Finance Committee hearing, and a profit warning by Target that sent retail stock prices tumbling Tuesday. Meanwhile, the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine continued with the price of Brent crude oil, a widely regarded measure of energy markets, soaring above $122, up nearly 60% since the start of the year.Cryptos have struggled against this wider backdrop and because of brewing uncertainties in the space, including not only the Terra debacle but regulatory uncertainty and problems with other protocols.""BTC fundamentals are intact, but without regulatory clarity, which is coming, we may stay range-bound, ""3iQ Digital Asset's Head of Research Mark Connors wrote to CoinDesk.Connors also noted the failure of the Ethereum 2.0 migration as a testnet to occur. ""In our opinion, proof-of-stake may be a 2023 reality, so not constructive for ether,"" he wrote.S&P 500: 4,115 -1%DJIA: 32,910 -0.8%Nasdaq: 12,086 -0.7%Gold: $1,852 -0.03%Major Korean Exchanges Are Delisting LitecoinThe last time Litecoin was relevant was when it was the subject of a fake news release about a partnership with Walmart.But Litecoin finds itself in the news again as major Korean exchanges are delisting its LTC token because of privacy upgrades involving the MimbleWimble protocol, designed to make transactions confidential and virtually untraceable.Korea’s largest exchanges cite the nation's law on the ""Reporting and Use of Specific Financial Transaction Information"" as the reason they need to de-list the tokens, but this isn't a Korea-specific thing. Korea's law was designed to align with the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) travel rule, a set of anti-money laundering standards adopted by regulators and financial institutions worldwide that requires the collection of customer data around transactions. Every major economy understands this and has implemented similar rules.Rules like this are the only reason institutions can even think about adopting crypto. For institutions, compliance is key, and they need to stay miles away from anything that even smells like money laundering.Many major banks know what happens if they get caught: fines in the billions. HSBC, Standard Chartered and others have all been hit with mega-fines for insufficient anti-money laundering controls.Crypto’s future is in institutional adoption, but there are certain things that just won’t work. While financial privacy is important and exists in crypto via the difficulty in identifying owners being blockchain wallets, financial anonymity is where the line is drawn. Making it impossible to track transactions ensures that institutions must separate themselves from the project and play no part in it.Certainly there are other protocols out there that are designed to obfuscate transactions. Tornado Cash comes to mind, and is often used in the same sentence as “stolen funds.” But even Tornado Cash doesn’t completely mix anonymity with freedom to transact: Wallets sanctioned by OFAC are blocked. Experts who have previously spoken to CoinDesk have said that without this happening, OFAC would be actively targeting the protocol.Litecoin mixing anonymity with an absence of such controls is going to be a headache for exchanges that list the LTC token. Korean exchanges are said to be particularly sensitive to regulatory affairs, so it’s natural that they would delist it first. But others are sure to follow.

It's possible central banks beyond the U.S. Federal Reserve might start to hold sway over markets. As central banks outside the region start to raise interest rates, theoretically making their fixed-income assets more attractive to yield-seeking investors, they make their currencies more attractive.That could have implications for bitcoin because its price is usually denominated in dollars, and the trend often coincides with moves in the greenback versus major regional currencies.""We're starting to price in much more aggressive tightening by the ECB,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at the foreign-exchange broker Oanda, said during an appearance on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" show. ""This is going to counter a tremendous amount of dollar strength. The consensus trade is going to be for the dollar to weaken in the second half of the year, not because of what's happening with actions by the Fed, but mainly because of central banks around the world.""Among altcoins, Chainlink's LINK token has gained 25% over the past five days as the provider of ""oracle networks"" for blockchains on June 7 announced a new roadmap for implementing staking rewards.

The analysts posited there may not be a ""greater distinction of narratives"" between the asset classes.""The market is still dealing with the crypto-specific fallout from the implosion of the Terra ecosystem,"" they wrote. ""Strong tailwinds such as new fund raises, progress on the Ethereum Merge, deeper institutional acceptance and continued application growth could shift sentiment in the other direction, highlighting crypto's relative youth, growth potential and technology angle.""Whether this is good or bad for bitcoin is an open question. But crypto traders have reason to be optimistic, according to the report, if bitcoin can break free while ""traditional markets grapple with worsening economic conditions and a still-uncertain [interest] rates outlook.""Ethereum leaps closer to proof-of-stake: The Ethereum blockchain’s first dress rehearsal for its upcoming Merge was successfully completed Wednesday. The Ropsten test network successfully merged its proof-of-work execution layer with the Beacon Chain proof-of-stake consensus chain – a process identical to the one that the main Ethereum network will undergo in just a few months (if all goes well). The much-hyped transition will fundamentally alter the second-largest cryptocurrency, decreasing its energy consumption and constraining the issuance of new ETH tokens, which many expect will boost its price.

Stablecoins – cryptocurrencies that peg their price to an outside asset, usually to the U.S. dollar – traded in the U.S. state of New York should be fully backed by certain assets, with these assets segregated from the issuers’ operational funds and regularly attested to by an auditor, according to the new guidance. The move comes after the implosion of what was once the third-largest stablecoin, terraUSD (UST), and regulators consequently increasing oversight of the asset class.

I’m Bradley Keoun, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights. (Lyllah Ledesma is off.)Price point: Bitcoin recaptures $30K, though analysts warn that further declines may lie ahead.Market Moves: The Wall Street giant Citigroup warns that last month's collapse of Terra's LUNA token and UST ""algorithmic stablecoin"" may have delayed cryptocurrency adoption, Will Canny reports.Bitcoin (BTC) climbed back above $30,000, a key pivot point, but the price appeared to be slipping in early U.S. trading hours.Cryptocurrencies were still broadly higher on Wednesday versus 24 hours earlier, with Chainlink's LINK jumping 14% and Cardano's ADA up 11%.The gains came even as traditional markets struggled, with investor fears rising over ongoing efforts by central banks globally to tighten monetary policy – to contain soaring inflation.Bitcoin's (BTC) price has tumbled 34% this year as Federal Reserve reserve rate increases and balance-sheet shrinkage have reduced excess liquidity in financial markets.The European Central Bank (ECB), led by President Christine Lagarde, is scheduled to meet Thursday and is expected to convey its own plans for tightening monetary policy. Money markets are pricing in 1.25 percentage points of ECB interest-rate increases over the rest of 2022, according to the German lender Deutsche Bank.""Many crypto traders are still nervous about one last plunge,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at the foreign-exchange brokerage Oanda, wrote Tuesday.The analysis firm Glassnode warned Tuesday that a ""full-scale capitulation scenario"" could occur at a BTC price range from $20,560 to $23,600. Blockchain data suggests that bitcoin miners are liquidating some of their holdings in response to a squeeze on profits.""The highest probability is that the market is within the second and historically final capitulation phase of a bitcoin bear market,"" they wrote.The giant U.S. bank Citigroup argues in a new research piece that a slowdown in crypto adoption might be one of the biggest consequences from Terra's collapse, Will Canny reports for CoinDesk.Last month's price crash in Terra's LUNA tokens (since renamed LUNC) and the crash of the ""algorithmic stablecoin"" UST below its $1 peg wiped out at least $40 billion of market value.According to Citi, nagging concerns about stablecoins generally have led to outflows from Tether's USDT. (Fitch Ratings estimated Tuesday that the market capitalization of all stablecoins shrank to $162 billion at the end of May from $188 billion at the end of March.)Such concerns have most likely compounded declines in crypto markets, the report said.According to Citi, “tentative evidence suggests a reduction in trading volumes and futures positions but not wholesale declines in investor interest in the space.""“Volatility has affected user adoption,” the Wall Street giant said.Link to full story: Citi Says Crypto Market Volatility Has Affected User AdoptionBy Oliver KnightThe Osmosis network was halted by core developers and validators at 2:57 UTC following the emergence of an exploit that may have led to about $5 million being drained from liquidity pools.The bug was brought to light by a community member on the Osmosis subreddit, although the post was deleted by the forum's moderator.The exploit came to light when a user deposited funds to a liquidity pool before instantly withdrawing it. The value of the withdrawal was unintentionally 50% higher than the deposit.The team took 12 minutes to halt the chain after the exploit had emerged, according to a Discord post by Osmosis community analyst, RoboMcGobo.In an update on Twitter, Osmosis wrote: ""Liquidity pools were NOT 'completely drained.'

Ether and other major digital assets also rose in the afternoon, regaining ground lost earlier in the week.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading above $31,200, about flat over the previous 24 hours but well up from its temporary perch below $29,300 in early Tuesday morning U.S. trading. Bitcoin had plummeted late Monday and has continued to trade in a choppy range amid widespread investor anxiety about inflation, geopolitical turmoil and the global economy.Ether, the second-largest crypto, was recently down over 1%, trading just above the $1,800 level. Other major altcoins were mixed with SOL off more than 7% but LINK up over 8%. Sentiment remained bearish.“The markets are continuing the long-term downtrend, but the recent crypto-friendly bill in the U.S. is giving short-term support as it proposes to gut the infamously over-reaching [Securities and Exchange Commission] in terms of their jurisdiction over crypto,"" James Key, CEO of Web 3 protocol Autonomy Network, told CoinDesk.Equity markets, which have swung up and down in recent days as investors digested a few upbeat tidbits along with their recent diet of bad news, climbed on Tuesday with the tech-heavy Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average all up more than a half-percentage point.Still, investors had plenty to worry them on Tuesday. The World Bank ratcheted back its 2022 forecast for global economic growth to 2.9% from the 4.1% it predicted in January. World Bank Group President David Malpass called ""the risk"" of stagflation ""considerable.” Later in the day, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told the Senate Finance Committee that she expected inflation to remain high. And less than three weeks after posting disappointing first-quarter results, Target warned investors that its profits would fall because of changing consumer behavior that has created imbalances in its inventory.Many analysts expect the crypto bear market to worsen in the near future, and Key noted that bitcoin's previous down cycles had bottomed out after 85% drops in value over at least 18 month periods. The current market has lost close to 60% of its value since reaching an all-time high last November.“I really doubt this is the bottom,"" Key said. ""In addition, those previous cycles were all in a long-term equities bull market, whereas that isn't true for the first time ever. When institutional investors are de-risking, 'exotic' and risky assets like crypto are the first to be sold, which indicates this time has the potential to be a worse bear market.""S&P 500: 4,160 +0.9%DJIA: 33,180 0.8%Nasdaq: 12,175%Gold: $1,851 +0.6%The Metaverse Struggles to Attract Committed UsersA recent report from Citi has calculated the total addressable market value of the metaverse at $13 trillion.If realized, this would be an impressive achievement considering that the value of the gaming market is only $180 billion, according to gaming research house NewZoo, and the market for PC gaming hardware is only $5.7 billion.For the most part, the Metaverse market is just a worse-performing version of the gaming market. Metaverse exchange-traded funds (ETF), with their exposure to publicly listed crypto companies, have lagged behind their gaming counterparts on the market – despite being mostly the same thing.Citi argues the $13 trillion figure comes from all “internet-related revenue to that of the physical-world activities being displaced.” This makes some massive assumptions about the future of e-commerce because it implies that all parts of the e-commerce stack are going to be disrupted by the metaverse.This seems to almost parallel the bullish mentality from augmented reality (AR) back in the late 2010s. If you would have listened to VCs and research companies, AR was ready to make unicorns by the dozens as mobile-driven augmented reality was ready to disrupt so many parts of the internet economy from gaming to advertising.But the AR space failed to generate any useful unicorns. Blippar, a promising London-based startup that melded artificial intelligence (AI) and AR, went insolvent in late 2018 after raising $37 million at a billion-dollar valuation.The app promised to revolutionize e-commerce by allowing users to point their phone at any object and get all the info the app could gather from visual recognition and online searches. It could also be used to provide augmented, 3D visualizations of products enhancing the online sales opportunities for retailers. This was all very interesting and promising for new revenue models, but the user base never materialized.Aside from Blippar, Magic Leap, which came out with promising initial visuals that it never managed to deliver upon, sucked the life out from capital markets for AR, depriving many promising AR startups of their means to create this promised augmented reality. Despite the success of Pokemon Go, there just wasn’t another AR unicorn like it.Going back to Citi’s metaverse predictions, much like the bull market around AR in the late 2010s, something is missing: users. On-chain data shows that despite lofty valuations, the metaverse majors struggle to build a user base with some only having a few thousand at most compared to the tens of millions of gamers playing simultaneously on Steam or Xbox Live.And it’s not because these are new platforms: PC gaming network Steam hit its first 1.5 million concurrent users six years after launch; Decentraland currently has less than 1,200 active users and has been open to the public for two-and-a-half years.We have a long way to go before the metaverse is a $13 trillion opportunity.Bitcoin Choppy Around $30K, Support at $25K-$27KBitcoin (BTC) remains in a choppy trading range as short-term indicators are neutral. The cryptocurrency could find support at $25,000 and $27,000 as its price continues to stabilize from last month's sell-off.BTC was down by as much as 4% over the past 24 hours.The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart returned to below the 50 neutral mark, indicating weak momentum behind the latest price bounces above $30,000. On the weekly chart, the RSI is the most oversold since March 2020, which preceded a rise in crypto prices.Still, indicators can remain oversold for several weeks, especially within a price downtrend.

The cryptocurrency has traded in a choppy price range, and so far upside has been capped as some buyers remain on the sidelines.Meanwhile, alternative cryptos (altcoins) were mixed on Tuesday. Chainlink's LINK token rallied by as much as 11% over the past 24 hours, compared with BTC's flat performance over the same period. Internet Computer's ICP token was down by 6% on Tuesday, and Solana's SOL token declined by 4%.Sentiment among crypto traders remains bearish, although some analysts and fund managers are starting to search for a price trough in the hopes of recovering from big losses realized over the past month.""For each cycle we go through in digital assets, the time to accumulate is during the bear markets, and those gains are rewarded exponentially when the bull cycle resumes,"" Two Prime, a digital asset investment firm, wrote in an email. The firm expects its portfolio to recover from a slump if BTC returns above $33,000 and ether (ETH) returns above $2,200, roughly 10% and 20% above current price levels, respectively.Two Prime's Digital Asset Fund, which also uses derivatives for income and hedging purposes, is expected to post a return of negative 31.4% for May, which largely followed the underperformance of ETH and other altcoins such as SOL.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.Most indicators suggest bitcoin is approaching the middle or end of a bear market. For example, the realized price model, which is an estimate of the average cost basis of all BTC in supply, is $23,600. Some analysts view that as a key support level, which could indicate a price low.""Historically, the overall market cost basis or realized price has been a very sound cycle support level, with 84.9% of bitcoin trading days closing above this level. In other words, only 15.1% of trading days have closed below the realized price,"" Glassnode, a crypto data firm, wrote in a blog post.To confirm a low, BTC would need to return above the realized price level, similar to what occurred at the end of previous bear markets. That suggests market participants haven't fully capitulated yet.""The bitcoin bear market is not over yet, although it has made a significant part of its way down. The market is full of rumors that short-term buyers have already capitulated,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.Rather, a bull market begins when medium-term investors and even some long-term investors capitulate, which could attract buyers at lower prices, according to Kuptsikevich. BTC is ""unlikely to reach this point before the price returns to the highs of 2017 (around $19,800),"" he wrote.Morgan Stanley sees crypto tightening: Weakness in crypto markets, the failure of the UST stablecoin and a reduction in leverage in decentralized finance (DeFi) are resulting in the “crypto equivalent of quantitative tightening,” Morgan Stanley (MS) said in a report.

Bitcoin has been ticking a little above and below this threshold since early May, depending on the day's events as investors nervously await clear signs about the direction of inflation and the global economy.""BTC remains weak until it conclusively breaches the $31k to $32k range,"" Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull, wrote to CoinDesk. ""However, we continue to see some buying below $30K that is keeping the price afloat.""Ether, the second largest crypto by market cap, was recently changing hands just above $1,800, up slightly over the same period and well within the range it's held over the last two two weeks under $2,000. Other major cryptos were about flat, although mostly on the green side with LINK and ADA among the biggest winners, rising 5% and 3%, respectively. Trading was light as is typical on most weekends.Cryptos' weekend holding pattern veered slightly away from equity indices, which closed down on Friday with the tech-focused Nasdaq plunging 2.4% and the S&P 500 falling 1.6%. Digital assets and stocks have correlated increasingly in recent months.On a more upbeat note, a better-than-expected U.S. jobs report on Friday, showing that nonfarm payrolls added about 390,000 jobs in May, suggested that the economy was far from ready to fold. Analysts have been concerned that the U.S. central bank's interest rate hikes will throw the U.S. economy into recession.

Then Japan.Stablecoin protocols finished another bumpy week of increased regulation and scrutiny.The protocols that peg a digital asset to a fiat currency, commodity or a mathematical formula based on some group of assets have been on the defensive since the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin (UST) token in early May. Observers of stablecoins, which are supposed to be lower risk than other digital assets, anticipated the extra attention, particularly for algorithm-based stablecoins such as UST.On Friday, Japan's parliament passed a legal framework around stablecoins to protect investors, making the country one of the first first major economies to pass a stablecoin-specific law. The legislation, which goes into effect in a year, clarifies the definition of stablecoins as digital money that must be linked to the yen or another legal tender and guarantees holders the right to redeem them at face value. The bill does not address existing asset-backed or algorithmic stablecoins.Only licensed banks, registered money transfer agents and trust companies can now issue stablecoins, although Japanese exchanges do not list them.The law followed less than two weeks after a report in the Korea Times that South Korean financial authorities would introduce measures to hold crypto exchanges to greater scrutiny following the implosion of UST and the LUNA token behind it. A two-day National Assembly emergency seminar to discuss the debacle, which may have victimized about 280,000 South Koreans, considered the role of exchanges and law enforcement, among other topics.""We need to make exchanges play their proper role, and toward that end it is crucial for watchdogs to supervise them thoroughly,"" Rep. Sung Il-jong of the ruling People Power Party said. ""When exchanges violate rules, they should be held legally responsible to ensure that the market functions well without any troubles.""The country's Financial Services Commission plans to build close ties with law enforcers ""to monitor any illegal acts in the industry and protect investors' rights,"" said its vice chair, Kim So-young.Bitcoin Weighed Down by $34K Resistance, Support at $20K-$25KBitcoin (BTC) continues to face strong resistance at its 50-day moving average, which currently sits at $34,000.The cryptocurrency has been anchored to the $30,000 price level over the past two weeks, absorbing a majority of trading volume. That could point to volatile price moves later this month.On the daily chart, bitcoin's relative strength index (RSI) is stuck below the 50 neutral mark, which indicates slowing momentum behind the recent upswing in price. The persistent decline in momentum means BTC's six-month downtrend remains intact.The weekly RSI is the most oversold since March 2020, which preceded an uptrend in price. This time, however, upside appears to be limited because of negative long-term momentum signals.Still, over the short term, BTC could stabilize above the $20,000-$25,000 support zone. The 200-week moving average, currently at $22,179, is another gauge of long-term trend support.BTC is on watch for a countertrend bullish signal, per the DeMark indicators, which could appear over the next two weeks. That could pave the way for a short-term price bounce, which would delay additional breakdowns on the chart. Upside moves could be fleeting, however, with secondary support at $17,673 providing a more stable ground for capitulation.9 a.m. HKT/SGT(1 a.m. UTC): Australia TD inflation MoM/YoY (May)9:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(1:30 a.m. UTC): ANZ job advertisements9:45 a.m. HKT/SGT(1:40 a.m. UTC): China Caixin services PMI (May)In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:US Added 390K Jobs in May, but More Crypto Firms Announce Layoffs, DOJ’s First NFT Insider Trading CaseAli Pourdad of Quantfury joined ""First Mover"" to discuss the latest crypto market moves as bitcoin traded below $30,000 and the market downturn leads to crypto industry layoffs.
