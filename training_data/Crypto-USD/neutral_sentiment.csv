3,"Don't miss CoinDesk's Consensus 2022, the must-attend crypto & blockchain festival experience of the year in Austin, TX this June 9-12.Well-known investor and ""Shark Tank"" star Kevin O’Leary said he isn’t ready to call a bottom in the crypto sector short of a major negative occurrence.“You don’t get a bottom until you have an event,” O’Leary told CoinDesk this week. “In the crypto world, we need someone to go to zero.”While such occurrences obviously aren’t positive for the players involved, these types of “panic events define bottoms” as markets capitulate before crawling out from their lows and slowly recovering, according to O’Leary.O’Leary spoke to CoinDesk ahead of WonderFi's June 22 move to the Toronto Stock Exchange from Canada’s NEO Exchange. WonderFi, a crypto marketplace and registered trading platform, counts O’Leary and FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried as strategic investors.O’Leary credits the move to the company’s enhanced oversight and compliance, as well as the work it's done with regulators on listing new coins and services. He said Canada’s crypto industry doesn’t allow for excess leverage, meaning WonderFi clients aren’t as at risk of margin calls.Institutions, family offices or individual investors “need to know with certainty that they're not trading on a rogue platform,” O'Leary said. “Completely compliant infrastructure” is necessary.O’Leary thinks global jurisdictions have taken – and should take – note of Canada’s crypto policy. “When you walk in with a Canadian flag on your back and you start talking about compliant crypto, people listen,” O’Leary said.Of the latest market rout, O’Leary said the volatility has been a plus for WonderFi and has boosted trading activity.Read more: Canada’s WonderFi Bulks Up Further With Planned $31M Acquisition of Coinberry Crypto ExchangeFor increased institutional crypto adoption, further regulation is necessary as institutions should be able to gain crypto exposure in the same manner they would stocks and bonds.O’Leary thinks stablecoin regulation is a place to start. He noted how USDC has held up amid recent crypto volatility, given its cash and short-duration Treasury bill backing. “The market is really receptive to something stable as a payment system,” he said.Additionally, O'Leary sees stablecoin regulation as a bipartisan issue. “Everybody wants to support the default currency, the U.S. dollar,” he argued.Bitcoin fell as low as $20,163 early Wednesday before bouncing back some.“A lot of people have losses who didn't understand the risks they were taking,” former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Timothy Massad said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover,” following the freezing of account withdrawals on crypto trading platform Celsius.The S&P; 500 has rallied to snap a five-session losing skid after a policy announcement by the Federal Reserve that raised interest rates to market expectations as the US central bank seeks to fight rising inflation without sparking a recession.The Federal Reserve raised its target interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point - its biggest rate hike since 1994 - and projected a slowing economy and rising unemployment in the months to come.After a week of announcements in NSW to improve the affordability of childcare and early learning, today Victorian parents are getting a turn.

6,"Cryptocurrency sell-offs continued through Tuesday morning, with drawdowns waning after the sector’s “Black Monday” saw over $1 billion in crypto derivatives liquidated over a 24 hour period according to data from Coinglass.Overall, the total crypto market cap has lost more than two-thirds of its value since peaking in November, according to Coinmarketcap, falling from $3 trillion at its apex to $952 billion as of Tuesday 11 am New York time.After briefly dipping to $20,950 per unit early Tuesday morning, the bitcoin (BTC-USD) price has settled at $22,652, a loss of 5.2% in the last 24 hours according to Coinmarketcap.Meanwhile, ether (ETH-USD) trades at $1,236 per coin, a 1.31% gain on the day after seeing some of the worst losses of major cryptocurrencies Sunday through Monday.According to DeFi Llama, the total market capitalization of stablecoins is currently $158 billion, down 16.4% from its May 1 peak of $189 billion, a 1% loss on the day.Analysts remain extremely cautious as investors await the Federal Reserve’s Wednesday FOMC meeting and press conference.“If Wall Street gets a very hawkish decision and press conference, Treasury yields and the dollar could surge once again and that would test the line in the sand many crypto traders have drawn,” noted Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.“If Bitcoin breaks below the $20,000 level, support might not emerge until the $17,000 level. Another crypto plunge might not see major support until the 2019 summer high around the $14,000 level,” Moya went on to say.Also drawing headlines on Tuesday was an announcement from Coinbase (COIN) that the company would be laying off 1,100 employees, or 18% of its workforce, in a bid to remain financially sound.“We appear to be entering a recession after a 10+ year economic boom,"" Coinbase founder and CEO Brian Armstrong said this morning in a blog post. ""A recession could lead to another crypto winter, and could last for an extended period. In past crypto winters, trading revenue (our largest revenue source) has declined significantly.""The major crypto exchange is the latest of crypto firms announcing layoffs including competitor exchanges Gemini and Crypto.com as well as the lender BlockFi, which have all named “crypto winter” as the primary reason for the cuts.In addition to the Fed announcement, traders are also waiting for more clarity on issues related to Celsius Network’s solvency, Noelle Acheson, head of insights with Genesis Trading told Yahoo Finance.Since pausing withdrawals Sunday evening, the crypto lender has “become a forced seller of other assets” according to Acheson.“The market is still digesting what this could mean,” she said, adding that even if the firm reopens withdrawals, Celsius could see a wave of redemptions that could trigger further selling.Here's a roundup of other crypto movers.Major cryptocurrencies such as Solana (SOL-USD), up about 6%, Cardano’s ADA token (ADA-USD), up around 4%, Chainlink (LINK-USD), up 15%, Polkadot's DOT token (DOT-USD), up 5%, and Avalanche's AVAX token (AVAX-USD), up 1%, have all seen gains on the day.Like bitcoin, sell offs continue for Binance's BNB token (BNB-USD) down 1%, Tron (TRX-USD), down 9%, and Polygon's MATIC token (MATIC-USD), down over 3%.—David Hollerith covers cryptocurrency for Yahoo Finance.

7,"Don't miss CoinDesk's Consensus 2022, the must-attend crypto & blockchain festival experience of the year in Austin, TX this June 9-12.Tokens of dogecoin (DOGE) and solana (SOL) rose as much as 16% in the past 24 hours to lead gains among major cryptocurrencies amid a broader market recovery.Crypto market capitalization increased some 4.5% after sliding under $1 trillion earlier this week and touching levels previously seen in early 2021. Bitcoin rebounded to the $21,000 level after a dip to just over $20,000.Bitcoin reversed Wednesday’s decline even as U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell announced a 75 basis-point interest rate increase, the biggest in over 28 years. The move is part of the Fed's effort to bring down inflation. The Fed also said it will continue to reduce the size of its balance sheet at the rate announced in May.A run in bitcoin and positive sentiment in the broader market saw prices of major cryptocurrencies increase. Ether (ETH) rose 11%, Polkadot’s DOT added 15%, while Cardano’s ADA and XRP rose some 7%, data from CoinGecko show.Still, some analysts remain skeptical about a sustained rally and said possible contagion risks from within the crypto industry, such as troubles at crypto lender Celsius and crypto fund Three Arrows Capital facing possible insolvency, could add to selling pressure.“The 'don’t fight the Fed' mantra has never been more relevant and volatility is anything but a surprise on the days of the Federal Reserve policy announcements,” Mikkel Morch, executive director at crypto fund ARK36, said in an email. “It seems that last week’s CPI print and subsequent comments by the Fed members already spooked investors so much that by the time of the actual meeting, a 75 basis point rate hike was already largely priced in.”“It now appears that we can expect the Bitcoin price to hold the $20K level. Likely, it will consolidate there for the foreseeable future and maybe even tag the $24,000 resistance unless there is more contagion risk from one of the troubled projects in the DeFi space,” Morch said.Outside of majors, Tron’s TRX jumped as much as 27% as the TronDAO, a community-run effort for the future development of Tron, deployed over $220 million to buy the token in the open market to protect the ecosystem's stablecoin, USDD.Other notable gainers were Uniswap’s UNI token with a 16% gain and the token of layer 1 protocol Elrond (EGLD) rising 21%. Underperforming tokens included shiba inu (SHIB) and KuCoin shares (KCS), which added less than 5.5%.The crash has now wiped over £300 billion from the combined value of crypto assets(Bloomberg) -- Crypto companies that have been trying to go public since last year’s boom remain stuck in a lengthy back-and-forth with US regulators, adding to the pile of challenges facing the industry.Most Read from BloombergChina Says It May Have Detected Signals From Alien CivilizationsStocks Jump as Powell Soothes Wall Street’s Nerves: Markets WrapFed Hikes 75 Basis Points; Powell Says 75 or 50 Likely in JulyWorld’s Central Banks Got It Wrong, and Economies Pay the PriceAmericans Are BuildAfter a week of announcements in NSW to improve the affordability of childcare and early learning, today Victorian parents are getting a turn.

Two consecutive days in the green reversed a Monday sell-off, leaving XRP up 0.09% for the week.Reaction to the Fed rate hike and forward guidance delivered support on Wednesday, while the SEC v Ripple case remains the key driver.Technical indicators remain bearish, with XRP sitting below the 50-day EMA.On Wednesday, XRP rallied by 6.81%. Following a 3.28% rise on Tuesday, XRP ended the day at $0.3433.A choppy day saw XRP fall through the First Major Support Level at $0.3011 to a day low of $0.2990 before making a move.In response to the Fed monetary policy decision and Fed Chair Powell’s press conference, XRP struck a day high of $0.3461.XRP broke through the First Major Resistance Level at $0.3339 to wrap up the day at $0.34. The Second Major Resistance Level, at $0.3465, pegged XRP back from more material gains.While the Fed and Fed Chair Powell delivered support, the ongoing SEC v Ripple case remains the key driver.This week, investors await a court ruling that could be a defining moment in the case. A court ruling in favor of Ripple Lab could force the SEC into a settlement and place a big question mark over the SEC’s stance on cryptos and the Howey test.This week, SEC and Ripple await a court ruling on whether William Hinman’s speech-related documents fall under the attorney-client privilege.In 2018, the former SEC Director of the Division of Corporation Finance said that bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH) are not securities.On Tuesday, June 7, the SEC and Ripple attended a court-scheduled conference. Judge Sarah Netburn scheduled the meeting to focus on the SEC’s claims that all documents relating to William Hinman’s 2018 speech should fall under the attorney-client privilege.Before last week’s conference, the SEC filed at least six motions attempting to shield the Hinman speech-related documents under the attorney-client privilege.The Ripple defense team and the XRP holders hope for a favorable court ruling. The general consensus is that the documents contain details that could damage the SEC case.William Hinman has, inadvertently, become a central figure in the SEC v Ripple case.In December, Empower Oversight, a non-profit government watchdog, filed a lawsuit against the SEC. The lawsuit claimed that William Hinman received millions of dollars from his former employer, Simpson Thacher.Simpson Thacher is part of a group that promotes Enterprise Ethereum. Empower Oversight claimed that the Hinman speech caused an ETH price spike before the SEC lawsuit against Ripple Lab, claiming that XRP is a security.At the time of writing, XRP was down 2.10% to $0.3361.A mixed morning saw XRP rise to an early morning high of $0.3470 before falling to a low of $0.3342.XRP left the Major Support and Resistance Levels untested early on.Avoiding a fall through the $0.3294 pivot would target the First Major Resistance Level at $0.3600. XRP will need the broader crypto market support to breakout from the 50-day EMA, currently at $0.3483.In the case of a broad-based crypto rebound, XRP should test resistance at the 100-day EMA, currently at $0.3700. The Second Major Resistance Level sits at $0.3766.A fall through the pivot would bring the First Major Support Level at $0.3130 into play. Barring an extended sell-off throughout the afternoon, XRP should avoid sub-$0.30. The Second Major Support Level sits at $0.2824.The EMAs and the 4-hourly candlestick chart (below) send a bearish signal. At the time of writing, XRP sat below the 50-day EMA, currently at $0.3483. Today, the 50-day EMA fell back from the 100-day EMA. The 100-day EMA eased back from the 200-day EMA, XRP price negative.A return to $0.35 levels would support a run at the 100-day EMA. Near term, the SEC v Ripple court ruling on the Hinman docs will be the key driver.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireYemeni journalist killed in car blast in AdenShares and bonds hit as Swiss rate hike adds to policy angstMeta, Google, Twitter pledge to better fight fake news or risk finesAudi files lawsuit against Chinese EV maker Nio over trademark rights – HandelsblattEDF hopeful end in sight for long-delayed, budget-busting nuclear plantSri Lanka to receive new petrol shipment within three days – ministerIt was a bullish session for the crypto market on Wednesday, with bitcoin and ethereum ending their extended losing streaks, supported by the Fed.Bitcoin miners appear to be preparing to offload large amounts of the asset as flows to exchanges peaked this week.After a week of announcements in NSW to improve the affordability of childcare and early learning, today Victorian parents are getting a turn.

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ended their extended losing streaks.The bullish session came despite the Fed delivering the largest rate hike since 1994 to curb inflation.Another choppy session saw the total crypto market cap fall by $84 billion to a new current-year low of $834bn before bouncing back.It was a bullish session for the crypto market on Wednesday. The broader market responded favorably to the highly anticipated Fed monetary policy decision, with bitcoin (BTC) ending an eight-day losing streak.Bitcoin was heading for a ninth day in the red with a fall to a new current year low of $20,084 before finding late support.Investor reaction to the Fed monetary policy decision tested bitcoin support late in the day before bitcoin tracked the NASDAQ into positive territory.After eight consecutive days in the red, the total crypto market cap recovered from another slide to end the day up $27 billion.Tracking gains across the US equity markets, the broader crypto market responded favorably to the Fed rate hike and FOMC projections.The total market cap fell to a new 2022 low of $834 billion before a move through to $950 billion levels. $84 billion came off the table before a broad-based crypto market rebound.While the broader crypto market responded favorably to the Fed, downside risks linger.Near-term, these include an anticipated shift in the regulatory landscape and the threat of a global economic slowdown.From the top ten cryptos, SOL rallied by 17.47% to lead the way, with ADA (+10.79%) and DOGE (+12.96%) close behind.BNB (+4.76%), BTC (+2.03), ETH (+2.39%), and XRP (+6.55%) also found support.From the CoinMarketCap top 100, UNUS SED LEO (LEO) and Bitcoin SV (BSV) bucked the broader market trend, falling by 7.51% and 6.26%, respectively.Tron (TRX) found much-needed support, with a 13.31% rally reversing a 12.99% slide from Tuesday.A steadying in the USDD and news of the TRON DAO Reserve making moves to reestablish the dollar peg, easing market nerves.While the USDD continued to sit below $0.98, the collateral ratio stood at 317.88%.Following Tuesday’s spike, total liquidations eased back further going into the Thursday session.According to Coinglass, 24-hour liquidations stood at $538 million, down from $578 million levels on the day prior. While down from the Tuesday jump to $1,070, however, 24-hour liquidation levels remained elevated.One-hour liquidations pointed to a steadying in market cap conditions, with one-hour liquidations at $11.78 million.SEC sent letters to crypto exchanges to establish whether the appropriate safeguards are in place to tackle insider trading.Fed delivered the largest rate hike since 1994.

SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has not been far from the headlines, with the SEC eyeing the task of regulating the digital asset space.Last week, we reported on a likely battle between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over the appointment to regulate digital currencies.The report was in response to a bipartisan bill beginning its passage on Capitol Hill, which looks to give the CFTC the coveted job of overseeing the digital asset space.On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported SEC Chair Gary Gensler raised concern over lawmaker legislation that “could compromise regulations that govern the broader capital markets.”Gensler held back from commenting directly on the bipartisan Lummis and Gillibrand bill.The SEC Chair did say,“We don’t want to undermine the protections we have in a $100 trillion capital market.”Adding,“Like behaviors should have like treatment.”Last week, US senators Cynthia Lummis and Republican Kirsten Gillibrand filed the Responsible Financial Innovation Act.The bill aims to tackle the classification of digital currencies as securities and non-securities. This is a subject on which US lawmakers, the SEC, and the CFTC have yet to agree.Gensler’s comments come at a tumultuous time for the digital asset space.The collapse of TerraUSD (USTC) and investor jitters over Fed monetary policy have weighed on investor sentiment.US regulatory uncertainty also remains a crypto market impediment.Earlier this year, lawmakers sent a letter to the SEC Chair questioning the SEC’s approach toward crypto firms. Lawmakers raised concerns that the SEC could stymy innovation. The letter was bipartisan, with both sides of the aisle co-signing the letter.With the SEC and the CFTC failing to find common ground, lawmakers may solve the issue.Neither are likely to give up without a fight. Lawmakers and regulators anticipate continued growth in the digital asset space.Until the US crypto market has clarity on the regulatory front, the SEC will continue to target crypto firms. A resolution could be around the corner, however.This week could prove pivotal, with a court ruling on an SEC motion to protect William Hinman speech-related documents under the attorney-client privilege expected.In 2018, the former SEC Director of the Division of Corporation Finance stated that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are not securities.The SEC case against Ripple Lab has been ongoing since December 2020. For lawmakers, the outcome could be decisive on who oversees the digital asset space.The SEC alleges that Ripple raised over $1.3bn through an unregistered, ongoing digital asset securities offering.On Tuesday, Stuart Alderoty, General Counsel for Ripple, talked about the failures to come to a consensus on how to classify cryptos.Taking aim at the SEC, Alderoty said,“4 years since the (in)famous Hinman speech, and we’re nowhere closer to knowing how to classify digital assets in the US – keeping every crypto, including ETH, in regulatory limbo.”With the SEC v Ripple case hanging in the balance, a former SEC employee speech could ultimately decide who regulates the digital asset space.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireFashion retailer H&M’s March-May sales jump a forecast-beating 17%UK confident it can overturn legal ban on Rwanda plan – ministerTop S.Korean economic, finance officials to meet ThursdayBiden’s approval falls in third straight week, nears record low -Reuters/IpsosEuro jumps on unscheduled ECB meeting, dollar towers ahead of FedGlobal tech on edge as WTO weighs e-commerce tariffsBitcoin price dives to $20,000, Ethereum’s ether tested the $1,000 zone, and BNB is struggling to stay above the key $200 support.As Bitcoin fell below $21,000 today, it took most of the altcoins along with it leaving less than a dozen cryptos to lead the recovery.After over $1 billion in liquidations over 24 hours, DeFi’s wild west period may be drawing to a close – but not everything’s a sham.The crypto market did not take a break from its downtrend streak even yesterday despite painting red for an entire week as altcoins sinked further today.Woolies and other big businesses will roll out the $40 wage hike in July, but smaller retailers are nervous.

Here’s why.","Don't miss CoinDesk's Consensus 2022, the must-attend crypto & blockchain festival experience of the year in Austin, TX this June 9-12.Crypto markets lost some 12% in the past 24 hours amid a weak macroeconomic sentiment and systemic risk from within to reach market capitalization levels last seen in January 2021.Bitcoin (BTC) slid 13% to under $25,000, its lowest in 18 months while ether (ETH) lost 18%. Dogecoin (DOGE) fell some 21%, and Solana’s SOL, Polkadot’s DOT, and XRP fell at least 16% in the past 24 hours.The top hundred cryptocurrencies by market capitalization recorded average losses of 15%, data shows. Despite the drop, crypto futures only recorded $1 billion in liquidations – a relatively low figure compared with previously high liquidations when prices did not move as much. This suggests that the plunge was led by spot selling.Weakness in cryptocurrencies came amid poor U.S. Consumer Price Index data for May released last week.Inflation surged to 8.3% over the past year, the report said, causing traders to price in further rate hikes of more than 175 basis points by September, implying two half-point and one 75 basis-point hike, as per Bloomberg.Such analysis led to a rout in global assets on Monday, with Asian stock indices ending the day 3.39% lower. Europe’s Stoxx 600 fell 2.2% since Monday’s start, and Germany’s DAX lost 2.18%. Futures in the U.S. opened lower. Technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 sunk 2.95% since Monday’s open, while S&P500 fell 2.33%.Traders said they expect crypto prices to continue to fall until market conditions improve.“We could be facing even more severe losses moving forward. Economic growth is clearly slowing, and reports already suggest the U.S. could see a recession in the next year,” said Manuel Ortiz-Olave, co-founder at equity tokens firm Brickken, in an email to CoinDesk. “Higher inflation will continue forcing higher interest rates, and higher interest rates are also negative for economic growth.”""Some of the most important companies in the world like Apple [AAPL], Microsoft [MSFT] or Nike [NKE] have already reported slowdowns in sales, and Tesla [TSLA] has indicated that layoffs will come soon. These are clearly negative headlines, which combined with higher food and fuel prices, make people be careful about their savings,” Ortiz-Olave said, explaining that a slowdown in consumer spending would lead to a loss of revenue for major companies.Meanwhile, possible systemic risk from within the crypto space contributed to the falling sentiment as crypto-lender Celsius paused withdrawals.The company allows users to earn yields of more than 17% on their crypto holdings and cited “extreme market conditions” as one of the factors behind its decision. This led to severe criticism among market observers on Crypto Twitter.Elsewhere, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) dedicated to the Tron ecosystem deployed $2 billion in funding to protect against a possible fall in the prices of its TRX tokens.“Funding rate of shorting #TRX on binance is negative 500% APR. Trondaoreserve will deploy 2 billion USD to fight them,” Tron founder Justin Sun tweeted. “Short squeeze is coming.”Monday’s drop seemed to stabilize with bitcoin trading at just about the $24,100 mark at writing time.With the “breakdown,” we should re-assess and adjust the Elliott Wave Principle (EWP)-based target zone.The S&P; 500 has rallied to snap a five-session losing skid after a policy announcement by the Federal Reserve that raised interest rates to market expectations as the US central bank seeks to fight rising inflation without sparking a recession.The Federal Reserve raised its target interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point - its biggest rate hike since 1994 - and projected a slowing economy and rising unemployment in the months to come.After a week of announcements in NSW to improve the affordability of childcare and early learning, today Victorian parents are getting a turn.

XRP sits below the 50-day EMA.On Sunday, XRP fell by 4.51%. Following a 5.75% slide on Saturday, XRP ended the week down by 13.2% to $0.3430.Market sentiment towards US inflation and Fed monetary policy overshadowed news updates from the ongoing SEC v Ripple case.Amidst the market reaction to US inflation figures on Friday, minor court rulings had a muted impact on XRP. This was despite the SEC having faced some tough questions at Tuesday’s court-scheduled SEC-Ripple conference.This week could be a defining moment in the SEC v Ripple case. A court ruling in favor of Ripple Lab may force the SEC into a settlement.On Tuesday, June 7, the SEC and Ripple attended a court-scheduled conference. Judge Sarah Netburn scheduled the conference, open to the public, to focus on the SEC’s claims that all documents relating to William Hinman’s 2018 speech should fall under the attorney-client privilege.In 2018, the former SEC Director of the Division of Corporation Finance said that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are not securities.Following at least six SEC motions to shield the Hinman speech-related documents, the court ruling could decide the outcome of the case.A ruling in favor of Ripple Lab may force the SEC into an early settlement. The SEC’s attempts to shield the documents raised speculation that the content could be materially damaging to the SEC case. This consensus has fueled the speculation that the SEC would settle in the event of an unfavorable ruling.There is no scheduled ruling date, meaning the courts could rule at any time. While the crypto winter has sent XRP back to sub-$0.31, a finding in favor of Ripple Lab should prove material for XRP.At the time of writing, XRP was down 9.27% to $0.3112.A mixed morning saw XRP rise to an early morning high of $0.35 before hitting reverse.Falling well short of the First Major Resistance Level at $0.3588, XRP tumbled to a morning low of $0.3034.The reversal saw XRP fall through the First Major Support Level at $0.3333 and the Second Major Support Level at $0.3236.Falling to a new current year low, it was also a first visit to sub-$0.31 since January 2021, which coincided with investor reaction to the SEC lawsuit against Ripple Lab.XRP will need to move through the Major Support Levels and the $0.3491 pivot to target the First Major Resistance Level at $0.3588. XRP would need the broader crypto market support to return to $0.35 levels.In a broad-based crypto rebound, XRP should test resistance at $0.3650. The Second Major Resistance Level sits at $0.3745.Failure to move through Major Support Levels and the pivot would bring sub-$0.31 levels into play. Barring an extended sell-off throughout the afternoon, however, XRP should avoid the Third Major Support Level at $0.2981.The EMAs and the 4-hourly candlestick chart (below) send a bearish signal. At the time of writing, XRP sits below the 50-day EMA, currently at $0.3758. Today, the 50-day EMA fell back from the 100-day EMA. The 100-day EMA eased back from the 200-day EMA, XRP price negative.A return to $0.35 levels would support a run at the 50-day EMA. This week, the SEC v Ripple court ruling on the Hinman docs, the Fed monetary policy decision, and forward guidance will be the key drivers.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireGoogle, Facebook, Twitter will have to tackle deepfakes or risk EU fines – sourcesBritish police charge Kevin Spacey over alleged sex crimesHow high?

At that time, the token’s name was LUNA. In the wake of the collapse of the blockchain’s algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST), in May 2022, the community voted to create a new blockchain.After the launch of “Terra 2,” the native token of the new network inherited the LUNA name, while the old blockchain’s token was rebranded to luna classic (LUNC).The goal of Terra Labs, the firm that developed the coins, is that the protocols and applications of the former network will migrate to the new blockchain (Terra 2). But as of June 2022, the future utility of the original Terra blockchain is uncertain.Luna classic priceAs of May 2022, LUNC’s all-time highest price was $119.02 (when it was still the old LUNA token), recorded in April 2022. The token rallied past $100 from a few dollars in less than a year and became one of the top 10 cryptocurrency by market capitalization as sustained demand for Terra’s stablecoin resulted in a dwindling LUNC supply.The main trigger for the demand was Anchor, Terra’s yield-generating platform, which offered eye-popping but ultimately unsustainable, annual rewards on UST deposits of up to 20%. As deposits on Anchor blasted through $14 billion in UST in April 2022, the circulating supply of the old LUNA tokens fell below 400 million tokens for the first time ever.In early May 2022, UST’s price deviated from the $1 peg and investors started to flee from Anchor, which was the main driver for UST’s demand. Steps to recover the peg proved to be short-lived, and UST lost its price peg during the week of May 9, 2022 again, eventually falling to pennies. UST’s collapse and the bank run on Anchor drove the original LUNA into a hyperinflationary cycle and the token’s price fell to cents.How does luna classic work?Luna classic was created to be the native token of the original Terra blockchain. It acted as the twin token that was designed to absorb any price deviation of the blockchain’s algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST). UST was supposed to keep a one-to-one exchange rate to the U.S. dollar by creating (minting) and (destroying) burning UST tokens to balance the stablecoin’s supply and demand at a $1 price peg.Many deemed the design inherently unstable and vulnerable to attacks. UST and LUNC eventually collapsed in the first half of May 2022, wiping out billions of dollars in investments from average retail investors and big-name institutions.Key events and managementIn early 2018, Do Kwon and Daniel Shin launched the Terra network with plans to develop an e-commerce payments app with a price-stable cryptocurrency.In July 2021, the company raised $150 million from investors, including Arrington XRP Capital, Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital and BlockTower Capital. The funding went to Terra’s Ecosystem Fund, which sponsors projects on the Terra blockchain. Prior to that, the company had raised $25 million in January of the same year.In September 2021, Kwon was served with a subpoena by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, asking him to testify about Terra’s Mirror Protocol. The following month, he and his company sued the SEC, alleging that the subpoena had been improperly served and that the SEC had failed to keep its investigation confidential because Kwon had been served in person at a conference.Early 2022 marked the launch of the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), an organization that was tasked to create a forex reserve for the UST in case of a severe crisis in the peg. LFG stepped up as a significant and very public buyer of bitcoin, amassing a $3.5 billion stash in cryptocurrencies (mostly held in bitcoin) in its reserve.On May 8, 2022, UST’s price deviated from the $1 peg and investors started to flee from Anchor, which was the main driver for UST demand. Steps to recover the peg proved to be short-lived, and UST lost its price peg on the week of May 9 again eventually falling to cents. Parallelly, UST’s collapse drove LUNC into a hyperinflationary cycle and the token’s price fell to cents.Amid the collapse, the Terra blockchain was halted twice to avoid any governance attack.As part of the efforts to revive the Terra ecosystem, the community voted to launch a new blockchain called Terra 2. That coin was released in late May 2022. The tokens were distributed to holders of the old LUNA tokens and to holders of UST stablecoins.The old blockchain (Terra) remained intact, its native LUNA token was rebranded to luna classic (LUNC), and UST was kept in circulation.After a week of announcements in NSW to improve the affordability of childcare and early learning, today Victorian parents are getting a turn.

This is why.","Retirement plan provider sued the US Department of Labor over recent anti-crypto guidance.One-third of clients spoken with since the guidance are holding back on crypto options.The Labor Department said ‘grave concerns’ citing Fidelity Investment’s plan for bitcoin in retirement.Crypto enthusiasts wondering if bitcoin (BTC) could enter their retirement savings had a sigh of relief in April when Fidelity Investments brought cryptocurrencies into 401(k) accounts.However, cryptos are highly volatile, which was recently proved in the Terra (LUNA), and TerraUSD (UST) crashes, leading investors shocked. Additionally, they have little practical use, given their vulnerability in crimes and the lack of real-world cash flows.This was the very reason the US Department of Labor had “grave concerns” when Fidelity included bitcoin in retirement plans.Additionally, DOL published a sternly worded guidance in March, revealing heightened skepticism of 401(k) cryptocurrency investments. The department, which regulates 401(k)-type plans, cautioned retirement fiduciaries to take “extreme care” before adding cryptos into their plans.Quoting the department’s anti-crypto compliance release, a San Francisco-based 401(k) retirement provider, ForUsAll, filed a lawsuit against DOL on Thursday.The company said that it is seeking the withdrawal of DOL’s cautionary release, citing the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The filing noted,“This lawsuit seeks to preserve the rights of American investors to choose how to invest money in their own retirement accounts. Brought under the APA, this lawsuit challenges DOL’s arbitrary and capricious attempt to restrict the use of cryptocurrency in defined contribution retirement plans.”ForUsAll accused DOL of focusing only on the risks of cryptos without mentioning its potential benefits, including diversification. The DOL has taken the “opposite course” by issuing the release, despite the Biden administration directing federal agencies to work on the development and use of cryptos, the firm stated.“DOL’s issuance of the Release was arbitrary, capricious, and otherwise not in accordance with law and in excess of DOL’s statutory authority, in violation of the APA.”According to ForUsAll, one-third of the clients that the company spoke with said, despite their interest in inculcating cryptos, “they do not intend to proceed at this time in light of enforcement threats.”The retirement provider let workers in retirement plans under its administration invest up to 5% of their 401(k) contributions in bitcoin, ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), ripple (XRP), and other cryptocurrencies.ForUsAll CEO Jeff Schulte told CoinTelegraph,“The government is suddenly trying to restrict the type of investments Americans can choose to make because they’ve decided today that they don’t like a certain asset class. They’re clearly trying to effect a ban, and they don’t have the legal authority to do so.”Several crypto advocates have offered various justifications saying Americans deserve more choice in their retirement plans. Surveys have also shown that particularly millennials tend to see crypto as a desirable investment. Advocates say that crypto investments can diversify a given portfolio as their price fluctuations aren’t synced with other markets.On the other hand, investors have had enough hard times navigating the US retirement savings system without adding an option that even professional investors struggle to hold. Challenges like crypto’s limited track record, bitcoin’s latest unexpected slide, which is more than 50% from its November 2021 peak, and technical difficulties such as ensuring safe custody in a largely unregulated realm, remain to be addressed.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireGermany aims for 30 billion eur investment in new start-up strategyKenya Aims to Lure Bitcoin Mining Companies with Renewable EnergyGerman energy regulator to slash LNG feed-in ratesExclusive: Feeling ‘super bad’ about economy, Musk wants to cut 10% of Tesla jobsUkraine says Russia trying to move war into ‘protracted phase’GBP/NZD Comes Back to the Bearish TrendAfter a week of announcements in NSW to improve the affordability of childcare and early learning, today Victorian parents are getting a turn.

But Pham said that she welcomes legislation that would further expand the CFTC’s jurisdiction in regulating the crypto space.""Just recently, U.S. banking regulators have come out and said that they're looking at payment stablecoins,"" Pham told Yahoo Finance. ""But, honestly, a lot of the stablecoins that are out there right now are being used for trading purposes. And, frankly, given the CFTC's broad jurisdiction, if something is not a security, then it's probably something that the CFTC has regulatory touch points over.""A bipartisan bill in the U.S. House seeks to expand the CFTC’s ability to regulate the trading of any coins or tokens that are not classified as securities (which would otherwise fall under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission). Currently, the CFTC only has the authority to regulate derivatives — such as cryptocurrency futures contracts — but not the spot products themselves, including actual crypto tokens.Other agenciesThere is an alphabet soup of financial regulators all waiting for clarity on how they fit into the framework for policing stablecoins. The SEC is still working on which digital currencies and projects fall into its remit, but the bank regulators like the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, have also jumped into the conversation.One proposal involves requiring private stablecoin issuers to become banks or other licensed entities. Doing so could allow bank regulators to regulate and supervise those projects by ensuring that their reserves are robust enough to guarantee the U.S. dollar peg.“This could enhance the ability to safely integrate them into the payments system,” New York Fed Executive Vice President Lorie Logan said on Thursday.Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu told Yahoo Finance banks can engage with stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, as long as they do not jeopardize the safety, soundness, and fairness of the banking system.""We have taken a careful and cautious approach to crypto,"" Hsu said.Brian Cheung is a reporter covering the Fed, economics, and banking for Yahoo Finance.

Bitcoin rebounded to the $21,000 level after a dip to just over $20,000.Bitcoin reversed Wednesday’s decline even as U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell announced a 75 basis-point interest rate increase, the biggest in over 28 years. The move is part of the Fed's effort to bring down inflation. The Fed also said it will continue to reduce the size of its balance sheet at the rate announced in May.A run in bitcoin and positive sentiment in the broader market saw prices of major cryptocurrencies increase. Ether (ETH) rose 11%, Polkadot’s DOT added 15%, while Cardano’s ADA and XRP rose some 7%, data from CoinGecko show.Still, some analysts remain skeptical about a sustained rally and said possible contagion risks from within the crypto industry, such as troubles at crypto lender Celsius and crypto fund Three Arrows Capital facing possible insolvency, could add to selling pressure.“The 'don’t fight the Fed' mantra has never been more relevant and volatility is anything but a surprise on the days of the Federal Reserve policy announcements,” Mikkel Morch, executive director at crypto fund ARK36, said in an email. “It seems that last week’s CPI print and subsequent comments by the Fed members already spooked investors so much that by the time of the actual meeting, a 75 basis point rate hike was already largely priced in.”“It now appears that we can expect the Bitcoin price to hold the $20K level. Likely, it will consolidate there for the foreseeable future and maybe even tag the $24,000 resistance unless there is more contagion risk from one of the troubled projects in the DeFi space,” Morch said.Outside of majors, Tron’s TRX jumped as much as 27% as the TronDAO, a community-run effort for the future development of Tron, deployed over $220 million to buy the token in the open market to protect the ecosystem's stablecoin, USDD.Other notable gainers were Uniswap’s UNI token with a 16% gain and the token of layer 1 protocol Elrond (EGLD) rising 21%. Underperforming tokens included shiba inu (SHIB) and KuCoin shares (KCS), which added less than 5.5%.The crash has now wiped over £300 billion from the combined value of crypto assets(Bloomberg) -- Crypto companies that have been trying to go public since last year’s boom remain stuck in a lengthy back-and-forth with US regulators, adding to the pile of challenges facing the industry.Most Read from BloombergChina Says It May Have Detected Signals From Alien CivilizationsStocks Jump as Powell Soothes Wall Street’s Nerves: Markets WrapFed Hikes 75 Basis Points; Powell Says 75 or 50 Likely in JulyWorld’s Central Banks Got It Wrong, and Economies Pay the PriceAmericans Are BuildAfter a week of announcements in NSW to improve the affordability of childcare and early learning, today Victorian parents are getting a turn.

The DAO later sent another $100 million for the TRX purchase, it said in a separate tweet.TRX rose to over 6 cents in Asian morning hours before a brief sell-off at the time of writing. The token was trading at 4 cents in European hours Wednesday. Futures tracking the token saw some $8 million in liquidations, one of the highest among major cryptocurrencies.Additional demand for TRX likely came as traders tried to bring USDD back to its peg amid a broader market run that saw bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) rise over 6.3% and 11% in the past 24 hours.USDD fell to as low as 91 cents this week amid contagion risks in the crypto market and weak macroeconomic sentiment. USDD is an algorithmic stablecoin on Tron and relies on an automated balancing mechanism that involves minting, or burning, of $1 worth of TRX to create 1 USDD.Earlier this week, Tron founder Justin Sun deployed over $2 billion as traders seemed to short TRX. Funding rates – or the interest paid by traders to borrow capital for a trade – to short, or bet against, TRX futures reached a whopping 500%. Sun said the capital was intended to “fight them.”TronDAO said in a tweet Tuesday that it added $650 million of USDC to its reserve to “safeguard the overall blockchain industry and crypto market.”TronDAO seems committed to protecting USDD’s peg to seemingly avoid a repeat of the implosion of Terra stablecoin terraUSD (UST). It received some $500 million in USDC Tuesday to “defend #USDD peg” amid “current extreme market conditions,” per a tweet.After a week of announcements in NSW to improve the affordability of childcare and early learning, today Victorian parents are getting a turn.

Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin and other cryptos have a dark day.Insights: Observers of digital assets react differently to Celsius's announcement to pause withdrawals.Technician's take: (In place of Technician's Take, First Mover Asia is re-publishing a recent Consensus 2022-related column by CoinDesk columnist Daniel Kuhn.Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover, our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.Bitcoin (BTC): $22,209 -16.6%Ether (ETH): $1,193 -17%There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.AssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorEthereumETH−16.4%Smart Contract PlatformBitcoinBTC−16.3%CurrencyDogecoinDOGE−15.7%CurrencyA Dark Day for Bitcoin and Other CryptosInvestors had their choice of comparatives for describing bitcoin's deep dive on Monday.Bitcoin sank to its lowest level since December 2020.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell to less than a third of its all-time high of nearly $70,000 just eight months ago and less than half of where it perched at the start of 2022.It was down 16% over the past 24 hours, a rare single-day, double-digit dip, and off over 30% from a month ago when it settled around $30,000 following the collapse of the terraUSD token. It fell for the seventh consecutive day.By most any measure, bitcoin had a very, very, very bad day.So did cryptos in general, whose combined market cap tumbled below $1 trillion for the first time since early 2021 amid ongoing inflation fears and a torrent of bad news from various protocols, including crypto lending platform Celsius's announcement that it was pausing withdrawals amid ""extreme market conditions.""Bitcoin was recently trading at about $22,500, down more than 16% over the past day. As for major altcoins, the question wasn't whether they were in the red but by how much. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands at roughly $1,200, off over 17% during the same period and its lowest level since January 2021. CRO was off more than 20% at one point amid news that the crypto exchange would pare about 5% of its workforce, roughly 260 jobs. Wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) and TRX were down nearly the same at that time.Market analysts had a lot to say about the plunge. Little of it offered immediate comfort.""It's a storm,"" 3iQ Digital Asset's head of research Mark Connors told CoinDesk in a phone interview.""Bitcoin bears certainly are in ruckus mode, berating the largest crypto the way a schoolyard bully seeks out for tormenting the same easy mark,"" Uphold financial consultant Rich Blake wrote.""Sentiment for cryptos is terrible as the global crypto market cap has fallen below $1 trillion dollars,"" Oanda senior analyst Edward Moya wrote. ""Bitcoin is attempting to form a base, but if price action falls below the $20,000 level, it could get even uglier.‘’As inflation proves to be an even trickier opponent to beat than expected, bitcoin and ether are continuing to get a severe bruising in the ring,"" Hargreaves Lansdown senior investment and markets analyst Susannah Streeter wrote. ""They are prime victims of the flight away from risky assets as investors fret about spiraling consumer prices around the world.""Cryptos' suffering tracked the hammering of major equity indexes with technology stocks at the forefront of the carnage. The S&P 500 fell 3.8%, re-entering bear market territory – meaning that it has lost 20% of its value from its previous high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, which hit bear market ground weeks ago, was down a whopping 4.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 2.7%.Even gold, a traditional safe-haven asset, declined by nearly 3%.Investors will be anxiously watching the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day meeting, which begins Tuesday and is widely expected to culminate with a 50-basis point interest rate hike as part of an ongoing effort to stem stubbornly high inflation. The latest U.S. Consumer Price Index report showed inflation rising 8.6%, a four-decade peak.3iQ's Connors noted optimistically that the current crypto spiral was ""within the band of growth"" relative to other steep drops in crypto's 13-plus-year history. ""I wasn't around in 2018 for that $20,000 to $3,000 move, but the playing field is much different now as far as the number of people in it (and) the presidential mandate,"" he said, referring to U.S. President Joe Biden's executive order regarding crypto regulation. ""If you take the band of volatility over the past five years, we're still within it.""Connors also said: ""The adoption rate the last time we checked both general wallets as well as institutions and mentions in 10-Qs are all at elevated levels. The fundamentals are intact.""Still, the crypto industry has found itself struggling anew Monday with a now less-certain future. Lending platform BlockFi said it would slice about 20% of its workforce. Crypto.com and BlockFi's cuts followed closely after similar announcements by the Winklevoss twins-led exchange Gemini and Middle Eastern crypto-exchange Rain Financial, among others. On Monday, Binance, the world's largest major crypto exchange by trading volume, paused withdrawals for a brief period.""As far as support levels, the next few days surely will test digital assets if a faster pace of tightening and more aggressive rate hikes are announced,"" Uphold's Blake wrote. ""For the moment, extreme market conditions and fed policy updates are exacerbating the consequences for crypto assets.""S&P 500: 3,749 -3.8%DJIA: 30,516 -2.7%Nasdaq: 10,809 -4.6%Gold: $1,821 -2.9%Analysts Differ on Celsius PauseProminent crypto lending firm Celsius paused withdrawals and swap products early Monday, citing ""extreme market conditions” amid a market downturn. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies lost over 12% of total market capitalization as traders responded pessimistically to the latest U.S. Consumer Price Index report showing that inflation continued to rise in May.Celsius’s announcement followed an April dictum in which Celsius told non-accredited investors that they could no longer transfer funds. The firm’s products are popular among crypto investors, and it offers yields of over 17% on deposits – a rate higher than those provided by most banks.While retail crypto investors winced over the news, sentiment among analysts and market observers was mixed as some criticized the move while others said Celsius could be protecting user funds.“Although such a decision is not unusual, as this is not a new phenomenon for centralized financial institutions, it will certainly affect the platform’s users and their desire to use centralized platforms like Celsius,” said Kate Kurbanova, co-founder of risk management platform Apostro, in an email to CoinDesk.“I think that this decision was made while taking the Black Thursday of 2020 as prices of major cryptocurrencies fell steeply and caused a cascade of liquidations on lending platforms and its users lost their money,” Kurbanova explained.Kurbanova added that users could choose what risks they consider acceptable, such as risk-facing liquidations and hacks on decentralized platforms but with the ability to withdraw money at any time or use centralized platforms which could be safer from a security standpoint but face a “risk of your assets being frozen for an indefinite period of time.”Some market observers drew parallels with the implosion of Terra’s terraUSD (UST) stablecoin in mid-May, which caused prices of its related luna (LUNA) tokens to drop nearly 100% and value locked on decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to plunge by $28 billion.“The broader industry gets very uneasy with the mention of any news or event that can hurt investors, be it retail or corporate following the May episode of Terra’s legacy UST stablecoin collapse,” explained Vadym Synegin, vice president at ecosystem project WeWay.“Celsius is sending out a message that it is currently insolvent and this is bound to usher in an unprecedented panic withdrawal whenever this access is granted to users. The crypto ecosystem does not respond well to panic events,” Synegin added.Some analysts opined Celsius could have switched to newer strategies to continue to provide yields to users.“Finding liquid assets that can pay high returns for $1 billion is not very hard to do; finding liquid assets for $30 billion, whilst keeping returns at such high rates, is almost impossible to do,” said Austin Kimm, director of strategy and investments at Choise.com, in a Telegram chat. “The only solution is to switch off deposits or move into much less liquid assets such as real estate, or crypto mining equipment.”Meanwhile, Fabio Pezzotti, CEO of crypto investment fund Iconium, said Celsius’s move to pause withdrawals was a preventive measure to help the firm stabilize liquidity on the popular staked ether (stETH) product.“During the last few days, rumors began to circulate that Celsius had become insolvent due to its high exposure to stETH, the Ethereum derivative by Lido Finance which began to lose its ETH ’peg’ last week,” Pezzotti said in a chat. “Talking about ’peg’ is not totally correct as stETH are derivative instruments collateralized by ETH 1:1. But since they become redeemable only after Ethereum’s merge, stETH’s price is decided by the market, which has determined a discount factor on the early conversion.“Celsius was holding stETH to provide returns on the ETH deposited by their clients on its platform. The FUD generated by the stETH depeg and the current market conditions have dried up Celsius' on-hand reserves, forcing the company to pause withdrawals to stabilize liquidity. This is a preventive measure, already seen during market crashes, which serves precisely to avoid a total collapse,” Pezzotti said.The 5 ‘Unsolved Problems’ of Crypto According to Dragonfly’s Haseeb Qureshi(Editor's Note: In place of Technician's Take, First Mover Asia is re-publishing a column by CoinDesk columnist Daniel Kuhn based on an interview at Consensus 2022.)Dragonfly Capital’s Haseeb Qureshi thinks there are five problem areas in crypto that you can make a fortune in solving. Those are identity, scalability, privacy, interoperability and UX (user experience).A former poker player turned venture capitalist and philanthropist, Qureshi looks to blockchain as both a source of revenue and social good.“The most important thing about crypto is permissionless innovation,” he said. “That’s the idea that you do not need to get a license or a business plan approved. You can just deploy a contract on-chain and it starts getting users.”See also: Dragonfly's Haseeb Qureshi Is Still Optimistic in the Crypto Bear MarketAnd so, Qureshi says, even if crypto has problems, it might prove its utility by allowing anyone to innovate.At Consensus 2022 in Austin, Texas, CoinDesk asked Qureshi to explain crypto’s growing pains, and how he thinks about its longstanding issues. Here’s what he said (the transcript has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity):PrivacyWhen you think about privacy, everything you do in DeFi [decentralized finance] is viewable. We've gotten used to that in crypto, but that's not the way of the future. There will be some trade-off that we can make that is going to be similar to the kind of privacy we expect in the real world that would still give us the auditability that we care about and that makes DeFi, DeFi.See also: Lunarpunks, Privacy and the New Encryption GuerillasInteroperabilityRight now, you're extremely aware of what chain you're on. You know if you’re on Solana or Avalanche or Ethereum. At some point in the future, almost without a doubt, you will have digital assets and you will interact with applications – and that will be your relationship with [the blockchain].On the internet, you don't interact with this service or that service. You don't interact with Cloudflare, and you certainly don't give a s**t about TCP/IP. Your allegiance is to your application. So in the future, if you want to do yield aggregation, instead of just looking at Yearn, you’ll look at what's the best yield anywhere in crypto. It will just be like calling out to another server on the internet.ScalabilityThe fastest blockchains do fewer than, like, 1,000 TPS [transactions per second] each. You can argue about the margin there, but the bottom line is that none of them do that much throughput today. And for us to really get to world scale, all blockchains need to be much faster, much more scalable and have a much higher throughput. That applies to rollups and the like, too.You want to get to not just tens of millions of users but hundreds of millions of users. Further, we talk a lot about users but we don't talk much about access patterns. If you want access patterns that look anything like what people do in Web 2, you need much, much, much more scalability.You could argue that bitcoin is the most used cryptocurrency because it has the most holders. I don't know the exact numbers, but something like 50% of Americans own crypto. I’d guess more than half [of those] only own bitcoin. And maybe there's one transaction those people, who likely bought BTC on an exchange, actually settle on-chain, if that, per year. If that's the case, the access pattern of someone using bitcoin is that one transaction.But what's the access patterns of someone using the internet? I don’t know how many Google searches I make per day. So a Web 3 user is gonna result in many transactions per day.IdentityThe issue here is having an online identity that can be relied upon. Let's say I want to offer you credit – credit is about your identity, about who you are but also about my recourse. I can only offer you credit if I know that I have a path toward getting it back. If I don’t know who you are and you run away, I'm underwater immediately. There's no recourse.Related here is bankruptcy. That’s a punishment that survives you and our relationship if you default on the debt. Bankruptcy is one of the most important innovations that we have made in capital markets. It’s very underappreciated in crypto. It’s the way you protect your remaining assets if you cannot pay back all your creditors and how credits can punish you into the future. You cannot do credit without the concept of bankruptcy. But in order to have that, you need Identity. Identity that persists.See also: Who You Really Are: A Conversation About Pseudonymity With Default FriendIdentity is also important for things like marketing. People don't think about this very often, but when you sign up for Coinbase, they can tell whether you're institution or retail. If you’re retail, they throw a bunch of incentives and charge you an arm and a leg for every transaction. If you're an institution, they don’t have to pay anything to get on board, but they charge you BIPs [bitcoin improvement proposals] because you're price-sensitive. Brokerages make all their money from retail.In DeFi, I can't tell whether you are retail or whether you are Jump [Crypto, the digital asset wing of the eponymous hedge fund]. The protocol treats everyone the same. A centralized exchange’s margin would f**king collapse. Imagine how much money could be made if DeFi businesses could know who their customers are. Nobody can do it today because there's no notion of identity.We're investing in a company called Quadrantid that allows you to selectively disclose parts of your KYC [know-your-customer] background. So you can selectively disclose your country or other parameters about yourself that you might want to prove to an application or business. This means you could KYC to receive an incentive, but may not have to.UXMetaMask, for instance, is not the most user-friendly way to transact. We've already seen some wallets start to do it much better, like Solana’s Phantom – great wallet experience. Keplr – great wallets. We've been able to learn from mistakes, and I think we're going to see more and more innovation.U.S. Federal Reserve meeting9:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(1:30 a.m. UTC): Australia house price index (Q1/QoQ/YoY)12:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(4:30 a.m. UTC): Japan industrial production (April MoM/YoY)In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" (from Consensus 2022) on CoinDesk TV:Senators Lummis, Gillibrand on Landmark Crypto Bill, Chessmaster Garry Kasparov’s Views on BitcoinSenators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand discussed their bipartisan, landmark crypto legislation live at Consensus in Austin, Texas.

Here’s how far it expects the market to drop.","Don't miss CoinDesk's Consensus 2022, the must-attend crypto & blockchain festival experience of the year in Austin, TX this June 9-12.The Tron network’s stablecoin, USDD, lost its peg to the U.S. dollar on Monday, dipping to as low as 91 cents, as crypto markets nosedived as investors grew increasingly concerned about persistently high inflation, tightening financial conditions and a potential recession.Tron founder Justin Sun tweeted Monday that the funding rate on the Binance exchange for betting against, or ""shorting,"" the Tron blockchain's native TRX token stood at negative 500%, a whopping rate that suggests many investors are clamoring to get into that trade. According to Sun, TronDAO “will deploy $2 billion to fight them.”TronDAO said in a tweet that it added $650 million of USDC to its reserve.Decentralized USD (USDD) is an algorithmic stablecoin on Tron, a multipurpose smart contract blockchain, which is supposed to keep a one-to-one exchange rate to the U.S. dollar. It relies on an elaborate, automated balancing mechanism that involves alternately creating and destroying units of USDD and TRX.It is also collateralized by holding cryptocurrencies, such as TRX, bitcoin (BTC) and other stablecoins, including Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC, in a standby fund known as the TronDAO reserve.Its design is eerily similar to Terra’s stablecoin, UST, which lost its price peg and eventually imploded a month ago, wiping out $40 billion in market value.Read more: 'Revolution' Promised by Tron's Justin Sun Looks Like Clone of Terra's Algorithmic StablecoinCryptocurrencies dropped sharply on Monday as Celsius, a crypto lender, announced that it suspended all withdrawals and transactions to prevent a run on deposits. It is the latest sign of a liquidity crisis in crypto, driven by a worsening economic environment around the globe and central banks hiking interest rates and draining excess liquidity from the financial system in an attempt to fight persistently high inflation.USDD fell to as low as 91 cents Monday morning on the crypto exchange KuCoin, indicating a 9% drop from its supposed peg, according to TradingView.According to the official TronDAO website, USDD’s collateral stands at $2 billion, while USDD’s supply in circulation is $723 million, suggesting that it holds enough capital to prop up the stablecoin by using reserves to buy USDD.At press time, USDD was changing hands around 99 cents but still had not recovered its dollar peg. TRX, the twin token of the stablecoin, dropped 17% in the last 24 hours.The S&P; 500 has rallied to snap a five-session losing skid after a policy announcement by the Federal Reserve that raised interest rates to market expectations as the US central bank seeks to fight rising inflation without sparking a recession.The Federal Reserve raised its target interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point - its biggest rate hike since 1994 - and projected a slowing economy and rising unemployment in the months to come.After a week of announcements in NSW to improve the affordability of childcare and early learning, today Victorian parents are getting a turn.

16,"Cryptocurrency sell-offs continued through Tuesday morning, with drawdowns waning after the sector’s “Black Monday” saw over $1 billion in crypto derivatives liquidated over a 24 hour period according to data from Coinglass.Overall, the total crypto market cap has lost more than two-thirds of its value since peaking in November, according to Coinmarketcap, falling from $3 trillion at its apex to $952 billion as of Tuesday 11 am New York time.After briefly dipping to $20,950 per unit early Tuesday morning, the bitcoin (BTC-USD) price has settled at $22,652, a loss of 5.2% in the last 24 hours according to Coinmarketcap.Meanwhile, ether (ETH-USD) trades at $1,236 per coin, a 1.31% gain on the day after seeing some of the worst losses of major cryptocurrencies Sunday through Monday.According to DeFi Llama, the total market capitalization of stablecoins is currently $158 billion, down 16.4% from its May 1 peak of $189 billion, a 1% loss on the day.Analysts remain extremely cautious as investors await the Federal Reserve’s Wednesday FOMC meeting and press conference.“If Wall Street gets a very hawkish decision and press conference, Treasury yields and the dollar could surge once again and that would test the line in the sand many crypto traders have drawn,” noted Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.“If Bitcoin breaks below the $20,000 level, support might not emerge until the $17,000 level. Another crypto plunge might not see major support until the 2019 summer high around the $14,000 level,” Moya went on to say.Also drawing headlines on Tuesday was an announcement from Coinbase (COIN) that the company would be laying off 1,100 employees, or 18% of its workforce, in a bid to remain financially sound.“We appear to be entering a recession after a 10+ year economic boom,"" Coinbase founder and CEO Brian Armstrong said this morning in a blog post. ""A recession could lead to another crypto winter, and could last for an extended period. In past crypto winters, trading revenue (our largest revenue source) has declined significantly.""The major crypto exchange is the latest of crypto firms announcing layoffs including competitor exchanges Gemini and Crypto.com as well as the lender BlockFi, which have all named “crypto winter” as the primary reason for the cuts.In addition to the Fed announcement, traders are also waiting for more clarity on issues related to Celsius Network’s solvency, Noelle Acheson, head of insights with Genesis Trading told Yahoo Finance.Since pausing withdrawals Sunday evening, the crypto lender has “become a forced seller of other assets” according to Acheson.“The market is still digesting what this could mean,” she said, adding that even if the firm reopens withdrawals, Celsius could see a wave of redemptions that could trigger further selling.Here's a roundup of other crypto movers.Major cryptocurrencies such as Solana (SOL-USD), up about 6%, Cardano’s ADA token (ADA-USD), up around 4%, Chainlink (LINK-USD), up 15%, Polkadot's DOT token (DOT-USD), up 5%, and Avalanche's AVAX token (AVAX-USD), up 1%, have all seen gains on the day.Like bitcoin, sell offs continue for Binance's BNB token (BNB-USD) down 1%, Tron (TRX-USD), down 9%, and Polygon's MATIC token (MATIC-USD), down over 3%.—David Hollerith covers cryptocurrency for Yahoo Finance.

38,"Don't miss CoinDesk's Consensus 2022, the must-attend crypto & blockchain festival experience of the year in Austin, TX this June 9-12.Crypto markets lost some 12% in the past 24 hours amid a weak macroeconomic sentiment and systemic risk from within to reach market capitalization levels last seen in January 2021.Bitcoin (BTC) slid 13% to under $25,000, its lowest in 18 months while ether (ETH) lost 18%. Dogecoin (DOGE) fell some 21%, and Solana’s SOL, Polkadot’s DOT, and XRP fell at least 16% in the past 24 hours.The top hundred cryptocurrencies by market capitalization recorded average losses of 15%, data shows. Despite the drop, crypto futures only recorded $1 billion in liquidations – a relatively low figure compared with previously high liquidations when prices did not move as much. This suggests that the plunge was led by spot selling.Weakness in cryptocurrencies came amid poor U.S. Consumer Price Index data for May released last week.Inflation surged to 8.3% over the past year, the report said, causing traders to price in further rate hikes of more than 175 basis points by September, implying two half-point and one 75 basis-point hike, as per Bloomberg.Such analysis led to a rout in global assets on Monday, with Asian stock indices ending the day 3.39% lower. Europe’s Stoxx 600 fell 2.2% since Monday’s start, and Germany’s DAX lost 2.18%. Futures in the U.S. opened lower. Technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 sunk 2.95% since Monday’s open, while S&P500 fell 2.33%.Traders said they expect crypto prices to continue to fall until market conditions improve.“We could be facing even more severe losses moving forward. Economic growth is clearly slowing, and reports already suggest the U.S. could see a recession in the next year,” said Manuel Ortiz-Olave, co-founder at equity tokens firm Brickken, in an email to CoinDesk. “Higher inflation will continue forcing higher interest rates, and higher interest rates are also negative for economic growth.”""Some of the most important companies in the world like Apple [AAPL], Microsoft [MSFT] or Nike [NKE] have already reported slowdowns in sales, and Tesla [TSLA] has indicated that layoffs will come soon. These are clearly negative headlines, which combined with higher food and fuel prices, make people be careful about their savings,” Ortiz-Olave said, explaining that a slowdown in consumer spending would lead to a loss of revenue for major companies.Meanwhile, possible systemic risk from within the crypto space contributed to the falling sentiment as crypto-lender Celsius paused withdrawals.The company allows users to earn yields of more than 17% on their crypto holdings and cited “extreme market conditions” as one of the factors behind its decision. This led to severe criticism among market observers on Crypto Twitter.Elsewhere, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) dedicated to the Tron ecosystem deployed $2 billion in funding to protect against a possible fall in the prices of its TRX tokens.“Funding rate of shorting #TRX on binance is negative 500% APR. Trondaoreserve will deploy 2 billion USD to fight them,” Tron founder Justin Sun tweeted. “Short squeeze is coming.”Monday’s drop seemed to stabilize with bitcoin trading at just about the $24,100 mark at writing time.With the “breakdown,” we should re-assess and adjust the Elliott Wave Principle (EWP)-based target zone.The S&P; 500 has rallied to snap a five-session losing skid after a policy announcement by the Federal Reserve that raised interest rates to market expectations as the US central bank seeks to fight rising inflation without sparking a recession.The Federal Reserve raised its target interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point - its biggest rate hike since 1994 - and projected a slowing economy and rising unemployment in the months to come.After a week of announcements in NSW to improve the affordability of childcare and early learning, today Victorian parents are getting a turn.

70,"Cosmos and a few other alts were the only few to close in the green today.Ethereum partook in the active downtrend losing more than 11%Bitcoin followed a similar path and ended up trading at $20,855.The broader market was expected to correct the ongoing correction, but the king coin, Bitcoin, and other altcoins decided to go down another path. Consequently, over $50 billion was wiped out of the crypto market in 24 hours.ATOM was one of the only few cryptocurrencies that closed in green at the time of writing following days of red candles. The altcoin had already witnessed a price fall of 32.8% within the span of a week, which only further added to the 86.4% depreciation observed since the coin hit its all-time high of $44.51.Thus some recovery would instill confidence in ATOM holders. And recovery is on the charts since MACD was heading towards a bullish crossover at the time of writing, with green bars appearing on the indicator.Unlike ATOM, Maker DAO’s native token MKR continued its downtrend, losing more than 10% in a single day. This has brought the price down to $701 from the highs of $2,301 the altcoin was at less than two months ago.Since April, the cryptocurrency has not been able to flip the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the 100-day SMA into support, which has led to multiple dips. In 2 months, MKR has dipped by 57%, 29%, and 48.5% on separate occasions as both the SMAs acted as a resistance level for the coin.The Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) token marked another drop on the charts, 11.54% nonetheless, as the altcoin came down to trade at $3.23. The slight growth observed yesterday did not do much for the coin anyways, as APE is 43.4% below where it was a week ago.The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remained stuck in the bearish zone inching closer to the oversold zone, a slip into which might cause the coin to fall further.Surprisingly the DeFi protocol token managed to sustain a rise at the time of writing, climbing the charts by 10.08%. Trading at $3.44, CAKE still has a long way to go in order to recover the losses witnessed throughout the week as it declined by 31.36%.However, the coin is observing no support from the price indicators as to whether the rally could go on. The Parabolic SAR continued to suggest a downtrend, which could keep the price consolidated for a while even if it doesn’t reduce further.The Bitcoin hard fork is facing the wrath of the bears, similar to other cryptocurrencies, sinking by almost 12% today following the 40% plunge observed in the last eight days. Trading at $113.59 at the time of writing, BCH might continue its downtrend for a few more days.This is because bearishness has only increased instead of diminishing, according to the Awesome Oscillator. The appearance of growing red bars backs the possibility as well.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireBank of England set to raise rates again as inflation heads for 10%Russia’s first deputy PM says rouble is overvalued, sees inflation easing – TassElon Musk expected to reiterate desire to own Twitter in meeting Thursday – WSJWall Street banks raise prime rates to match Fed’s hikeBrazilian police find human remains in search for British journalist -ministerAirAsia X to add long-haul routes, including London, as demand reboundsBitcoin price dives to $20,000, Ethereum’s ether tested the $1,000 zone, and BNB is struggling to stay above the key $200 support.Valkyrie Funds CEO Leah Wald joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss bitcoin falling below $21,000, the crypto sell-off, bear markets, and the outlook for the cryptocurrency market.Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman discusses how stocks are trading in anticipation of the Fed's decision on Wednesday.Companies have been competing fiercely for skilled workers due to widespread labour shortages.

136,"Cryptocurrency sell-offs continued through Tuesday morning, with drawdowns waning after the sector’s “Black Monday” saw over $1 billion in crypto derivatives liquidated over a 24 hour period according to data from Coinglass.Overall, the total crypto market cap has lost more than two-thirds of its value since peaking in November, according to Coinmarketcap, falling from $3 trillion at its apex to $952 billion as of Tuesday 11 am New York time.After briefly dipping to $20,950 per unit early Tuesday morning, the bitcoin (BTC-USD) price has settled at $22,652, a loss of 5.2% in the last 24 hours according to Coinmarketcap.Meanwhile, ether (ETH-USD) trades at $1,236 per coin, a 1.31% gain on the day after seeing some of the worst losses of major cryptocurrencies Sunday through Monday.According to DeFi Llama, the total market capitalization of stablecoins is currently $158 billion, down 16.4% from its May 1 peak of $189 billion, a 1% loss on the day.Analysts remain extremely cautious as investors await the Federal Reserve’s Wednesday FOMC meeting and press conference.“If Wall Street gets a very hawkish decision and press conference, Treasury yields and the dollar could surge once again and that would test the line in the sand many crypto traders have drawn,” noted Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.“If Bitcoin breaks below the $20,000 level, support might not emerge until the $17,000 level. Another crypto plunge might not see major support until the 2019 summer high around the $14,000 level,” Moya went on to say.Also drawing headlines on Tuesday was an announcement from Coinbase (COIN) that the company would be laying off 1,100 employees, or 18% of its workforce, in a bid to remain financially sound.“We appear to be entering a recession after a 10+ year economic boom,"" Coinbase founder and CEO Brian Armstrong said this morning in a blog post. ""A recession could lead to another crypto winter, and could last for an extended period. In past crypto winters, trading revenue (our largest revenue source) has declined significantly.""The major crypto exchange is the latest of crypto firms announcing layoffs including competitor exchanges Gemini and Crypto.com as well as the lender BlockFi, which have all named “crypto winter” as the primary reason for the cuts.In addition to the Fed announcement, traders are also waiting for more clarity on issues related to Celsius Network’s solvency, Noelle Acheson, head of insights with Genesis Trading told Yahoo Finance.Since pausing withdrawals Sunday evening, the crypto lender has “become a forced seller of other assets” according to Acheson.“The market is still digesting what this could mean,” she said, adding that even if the firm reopens withdrawals, Celsius could see a wave of redemptions that could trigger further selling.Here's a roundup of other crypto movers.Major cryptocurrencies such as Solana (SOL-USD), up about 6%, Cardano’s ADA token (ADA-USD), up around 4%, Chainlink (LINK-USD), up 15%, Polkadot's DOT token (DOT-USD), up 5%, and Avalanche's AVAX token (AVAX-USD), up 1%, have all seen gains on the day.Like bitcoin, sell offs continue for Binance's BNB token (BNB-USD) down 1%, Tron (TRX-USD), down 9%, and Polygon's MATIC token (MATIC-USD), down over 3%.—David Hollerith covers cryptocurrency for Yahoo Finance.
