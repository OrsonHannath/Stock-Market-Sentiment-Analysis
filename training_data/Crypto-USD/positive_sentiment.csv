Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Cryptos climbed late in the day, but not enough to dispel the prolonged bearish sentiment.Insights: Indian crypto investors receive some upbeat news.Technician's take: BTC continues to trade at about $30,000 as indicators remain neutral.Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.

Ether was changing hands at just above $1,800, up slightly for the same period. Most other major cryptos rose late with ADA recently rising nearly 6%, and APE up over 4%. Trading was choppy as investors continued to shy away from riskier assets – their behavior a product of inflationary and recessionary fears that have mushroomed steadily this year.""Bitcoin will get its groove back once bearish sentiment on Wall Street improves, but that will likely take several more weeks,"" Oanda senior markets analyst Edward Moya wrote in an email.Stocks rose as the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 2.6%, the S&P 500 climbed 1.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2%. Gold, a traditional safe haven in down markets, increased by more than a percentage point, underscoring the current uncertainty among investors.The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied countries said that they would boost the supply of oil by an unexpectedly large amount. The U.S. and other countries had been pressing the organization to loosen its current limits to help lower energy prices. The price of Brent crude oil, which is a widely watched measure of energy markets, rose to $118 per barrel, a more than 53% spike since the start of the year.The looming prospect of recession continued to ripple through the technology sector on Thursday with Microsoft (MSFT) ratcheting back its earnings and sales projections for the current quarter. Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX), among others, reported weak first-quarter financial results last month, noting the effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and unsettling macroeconomic conditions.The crypto industry has also felt the impact of the current, dour economic mood with crypto exchange Coinbase announcing in a blog post by Chief People Officer L.J. Brock, that it would ""extend our hiring pause for both new and backfill roles for the foreseeable future and rescind a number of accepted offers."" The move came a just hours after crypto exchange and custodian Gemini, the brainchild of billionaire twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, said it would lay off 10% of its workforce, about 100 employees.The crypto industry is in a “contraction phase that is settling into a period of stasis,” also known as a “crypto winter,” the twins wrote in a blog post.Oanda's Moya noted that investors' ""risk appetite"" will depend on ""expectations"" of what the U.S. central bank ""will do beyond the summer.""""Bitcoin is forming a base but most traders are still licking their wounds,"" he wrote. ""If bitcoin can recapture the $33,500 level, that is what is needed for technical buying to get triggered.""S&P 500: 4,176 +1.8%DJIA: 33,248 +1.3%Nasdaq: 12,316 +2.6%Gold: $1,868 +1.2%Upbeat News for Indian Crypto InvestorsIndia's crypto investors had some upbeat news for a change with trading platform CoinSwitch Kuber's announcement on Thursday that it had launched a rupee-denominated index to provide real-time information on the performance of the eight largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.The Crypto Rupee Index (CRE8) is a first in the Indian market, which has previously had to ""rely on the international indices based on the US Dollar,"" CoinSwitch Kuber CEO and co-founder Ashish Singhal tweeted. ""But these indices do not give the true picture of the Indian market and miss the supply-demand dynamics of India’s growing investor base,"" he added.CoinSwitch Kuber is among the country's largest crypto exchanges with a self-reported 18 million users of its app. Its investors include venture capital heavyweights Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Coinbase Ventures, Tiger Global and Sequoia Capital.The announcement follows a difficult few months for the digital assets industry in India, despite the country's growing appetite for cryptocurrencies. In April, Indians began paying a 30% capital gains tax on crypto transactions after Parliament passed a controversial tax law. The legislation, which the industry vehemently opposed, will also require crypto investors in the country to pay a 1% tax deducted at source, as well as taxes on crypto gifts, with no ability to take deductions for losses, starting on July 1.Trading volumes plunged on major Indian exchanges in the days after the capital gains tax went into effect with at least one analyst predicting that they would not return to pre-tax law levels. The industry was subsequently rocked by the rough launch of Coinbase's crypto trading services in the country.CoinSwitch Kuber said that CRE8 will be refreshed over 1,400 times a day to ensure it reflects real-time market movement, and that it will track eight crypto assets that represent over 85% of the total market capitalization of the crypto market traded in Indian rupees.Singhal noted Indian investors' demand for better crypto services and information. ""#CRE8 is a demonstration of our commitment to bring more transparency to the Indian crypto market and equip users with a simple, easy-to-understand measure of the Indian market. Indian investors and market observers no longer have to second-guess how the Indian Crypto market is behaving,"" Singhal tweeted.Bitcoin Stabilizes in Tight Trading Range, Resistance at $33KBitcoin held initial support near $29,300, which was where an upswing in price originated over the past weekend. As of Thursday afternoon, the cryptocurrency remained in a tight intraday range, with a midpoint at $30,100. That's where the most trading volume occurred over the past two weeks. For now, BTC's price could continue to revert to that midpoint level until a decisive breakout or breakdown is confirmed.Upside appears to be limited at between the $33,000-$35,000 resistance zone, especially as momentum signals remain negative on long-term charts.Still, momentum remains positive on the daily chart, which could keep short-term buyers active.

Meanwhile, some alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) are outperforming BTC, which could encourage some buyers to return from the sidelines.Internet Computer's ICP token rallied by as much as 20% over the past 24 hours, while Cardano's ADA token was up by 4% over the same period. Meanwhile, Solana's SOL token was down by 2% over the past 24 hours after a network outage on Wednesday.Just launched! Please sign up for our daily Market Wrap newsletter explaining what happens in crypto markets – and why.On the regulatory front, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Gemini Trust Co. Thursday, alleging the crypto exchange’s staff misled the federal regulator during Gemini’s effort in 2017 to start trading of what would have been a landmark bitcoin futures contract. CoinDesk's Nik De has the latest here.The Gemini case highlights concerns about exchange data and potential market manipulation. For example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has continuously struck down proposals for a spot-based bitcoin exchange-traded fund, citing issues related to volatility, fraud and price manipulation.●Bitcoin (BTC): $30,300, +0.90%●Ether (ETH): $1,823, +0.35%●S&P 500 daily close: 4,177, +1.84%●Gold: $1,873 per troy ounce, +1.62%●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.91%Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

That spike in activity, however, was short-lived.""The recent sell-off and lower prices has not yet inspired an influx of new users to the space,"" Glassnode wrote in a blog post.Meanwhile, existing entities on the network (possibly long-term holders) have been accumulating additional BTC on price dips, especially over the past two weeks. Still, the level of accumulation has been minor relative to previous phases.Bitcoin miners have been distributing their holdings of BTC during the recent sell-off, albeit at a slower pace compared with earlier this year. Still, it is unclear if the miners' position changes will lead or react to BTC price swings.The chart below shows the 30-day change of BTC supply held in miner addresses, according to data compiled by Glassnode.Solana outage: The Solana network suffered its latest outage Wednesday, felled for over four hours by a bug in how the blockchain processes a niche type of transaction that’s designed for offline use cases. Validators began restarting the network only after disabling these “durable nonce transactions,” Solana Labs communications chief Austin Federa told CoinDesk. Solana's SOL token is down by 9% over the past week, compared with a 3% rise in BTC over the same period.

The decline was bitcoin's eighth consecutive day of losses. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has now dropped nearly 30% of its value over the past month and is threatening to test the not-long-ago unthinkable idea of support below $20,000, roughly where it stood in 2017.Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands at roughly $1,200, about flat from Monday when it hit a more than 18-month low. Among altcoins, SOL and XLM were recently up more than 5% after plunging on Monday, but WBTC and TRX continued to suffer with the latter off by over 13% at one point.Crypto investors are nervously awaiting the U.S. central bank latest interest rate increase, which many observers now believe will be 75 basis points, harsh, inflationary medicine that seemed unlikely until the Consumer Price Index showed inflation continuing at four-year highs. Whether hawkish policy can tame inflation without sparking a recession remains uncertain.""Bitcoin traders better be buckled up heading into the FOMC decision,"" Oanda senior analyst Americas Edward Moya wrote in an email. Bitcoin is still holding the $20,000 level and if Wall Street gets a very hawkish decision and press conference, Treasury yields and the dollar could surge once again and that would test the line in the sand many crypto traders have drawn.""Stocks were calmer on Tuesday after the previous day's battering with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq all about flat. Gold, a traditional safe haven asset, was also down, however, a reminder of the degree of skittishness among investors.""Wall Street was quick to fade the morning rebound that stemmed a modest improvement with producer prices, possibly providing some hope that core inflation continues to ease for businesses,"" Moya wrote.Meanwhile, bad news and disturbing trends continued to plague crypto markets, with exchange giant Coinbase announcing the layoff of about 18% of its workforce – some 1,100 jobs. The cuts were the latest among major exchanges, following those in recent days by Winklevoss twins-led Gemini, Middle Eastern-based Rain Financial and Latin America-based Bitso and Buenbit.Data on Tuesday also showed that crypto-tracked futures had lost over $1 billion over a 24-hour period, a victim of the fraught investment environment. Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).Also late Tuesday, Fox Business reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was investigating whether crypto exchanges have sufficient protections against insider trading. The SEC has sent a letter to a major crypto exchange inquiring about its safeguards and comes amid increasing scrutiny of the terraUSD stablecoin implosion and more widely, according to the report.Oanda's Moya was pessimistic about crypto's prospects going forward. ""If bitcoin breaks below the $20,000 level, support might not emerge until the $17,000 level,"" he wrote. ""Another crypto plunge might not see major support until the 2019 summer high around the $14,000 level.""S&P 500: 3,735 -0.3%DJIA: 30,364 -0.5%Nasdaq: 10,828 +0.1%Gold: $1,808 -0.6%Traders See Bitcoin Dropping Below $20,000Bitcoin stabilized Tuesday at about $22,000 after crumbling Monday amid inflation fears and wider macroeconomic weakness. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had followed major Asian indices which continued their own recent spiral, closing at least 1% lower.Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 1.32% as the yen tumbled to its lowest level against the dollar since 1998. The currency has declined 15% this year, becoming one of the worst-performing major currencies. Meanwhile, stocks in Tokyo slid the most since March and bond yields hit ceiling values, the Japan Times reported.The decline came after the U.S. released poorer-than-expected inflation data for May in a report last week, which saw inflation increase by 8.6% compared to last year. Traders are now pricing in rate hikes of over 175 basis points through September, which is expected to bring down company revenues and slow down consumer spending.“The crux of the concern plaguing investors is how harshly the [U.S. Federal Reserve] plans to tackle rising inflation in the face of stark new [consumer price index] data,” said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, in an email. “Getting the balance wrong and hiking interest rates too aggressively could see recession fears become a reality.”Crypto traders and analysts are remaining similarly bearish. FxPro senior market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich said in a note Tuesday that market sentiment remained in “extreme fear” mode as bitcoin saw its biggest decline since early 2020.Kuptsikevich added that bitcoin prices could tumble to 2017 highs under $20,000 before long-term buyers return to the market, and provided macroeconomic sentiment improves.Bradley Duke, co-CEO at crypto exchange-traded product provider ETC Group, also stated bitcoin could retest 2017’s levels with the “next major support” at “$20,000.” “Crypto markets are in extreme fear mode, with the only recent comparable period of extended low sentiment stretching back to March 2020,” he said.Meanwhile, some investors said a decline in bitcoin prices was tied to a rout in global stocks.“The global economic environment is becoming extremely tough to navigate for investors involved in all kinds of markets, so it is no surprise that bitcoin is also facing increased downward pressure,” said Mikkel Morch, executive director at crypto/digital asset hedge fund ARK36. He added: “Over the past couple of years, cryptocurrencies have become a global macro asset and so it is to be expected that they will react negatively now when investors realize that central banks haven’t reacted nearly as aggressively as they will need to in order to get inflation under control.”Pussy Riot, Political Action and the Future of DAOsGrowing up, Nadya Tolokonnikova, one of the founders of protest collective Pussy Riot, wanted to be a feminist. That’s what the 32-year-old artist and punk rocker told CoinDesk at Consensus 2022 in Austin, Texas.Pussy Riot, Tolokonnikova explained while sitting on the floor of the Austin Convention Center, is often mistakenly thought of as just a punk-rock outfit – one that first made headlines in 2012 for its anti-Putin anthems. But the group, which operates like an off-chain decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), is so much more.This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.“Anyone can join Pussy Riot,” Tolokonnikova said on the Big Ideas stage on Saturday. “We're open source, we write our own code … We’re decentralized, we’re autonomous and we’re an organization.”The artistic, political collective – which counts over 100 members, of which a punk band is just a small part – is working toward a more equal world. Over the past decade, Pussy Riot has founded media companies, published books and staged protests on and offline to further their “global feminist protest art movement.”See also: Crypto: The Gift That Keeps On Giving (to Charity) | OpinionLately, the group has been using the censorship-resistant tools enabled by crypto. Tolokonnikova was a co-founder of women and LGBTQ+ activist group Unicorn DAO. She also helped found Ukraine DAO, which auctioned an image of the Ukrainian flag in March for 2,258 ETH (approximately $6.75 million at the time) to support people affected by the Russian invasion.“My goal is for future generations that are going to be onboarding into Web 3 … will have gender equality,” Tolokonnikova said. “This is how I see my role in crypto.”Last week, as the Consensus event was unfolding a few blocks to the south, members of Pussy Riot, UnicornDAO and the Lakota Indigenous group Ikiya Collective charged into the Texas State Capitol building to stage a protest.They unfurled a 45-foot banner reading “MATRIARCHY NOW!” from the third floor and then rushed out of the building. The moment of “domination” was minted as a non-fungible token (NFT) using auction platform Party Bid. To date, the group has raised 2.38980764 ETH – worth just shy of $3,000 – from 23 contributors to fund reproductive rights.John Caldwell, a founder of Unicorn, said the group was “surprised” by how little attention and support this protest action has received. Texas, a U.S. state known for supporting the ideals of autonomy, personal freedom and limited state intervention, has been at the forefront of the conservative-led charge to roll back abortion rights, he said.“I didn’t come here for the conference, I came here to protest,” Tolokonnikova said, adding that the crowdfunding model allows anyone who’s so inclined to contribute dollars or cents to their cause. Decrypt reported “mixed reactions,” with some Capitol building visitors snapping pictures and others hurrying out of the way.Though she’s similarly taken aback by how little buzz the Capitol publicity stunt generated, Tolokonnikova said crypto is full of energy. “A lot of people here are visionaries. They want to build a better world,” she said.Perhaps no one knows better than Tolokonnikova how much work goes on behind the scenes at activist causes. She said she splits her time doing logistical work for the DAO – answering emails, participating in her Discord channels, speaking to artists and auction houses – and planning showstopping events.As co-founder of independent media outlet Mediazona, she has spoken before the U.S. Congress, British Parliament, European Parliament and performed at Banksy's Dismaland exhibition.See also: DAOs and the Coming InDAOstrial Revolution | OpinionAt an earlier Consensus event on the Big Ideas stage, Ellie Rennie, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) professor and head of the Australian university’s Blockchain Innovation Hub, said DAOs are a new type of organization that will require a new mix of interpersonal and technological skills to get right.She noted that we should also not vilify DAOs that experiment and fail. “To be transient is OK,” she said. “We need to find what makes communities resilient.”Perhaps the hardest task for DAO managers, faced with a tool that adds elements of financialization and speculation to social causes, is creating ways to “align” everyone’s needs. Economic incentives may encourage participation, but perhaps not commitment.Others come to crypto precisely because it is apolitical – a space that seems insulated from the dramas, inconsistencies and superficialities of modern-day politics. Crypto, by creating tools that anyone can use, has a plausible case for being “credibly neutral.”Of course, some would disagree. Perhaps crypto will only rebound from the unfolding bear market if it finds a way to meaningfully engage with the world. In politics, perhaps that means crypto becoming an effective tool for change.“Being apolitical there is no such thing,” Tolokonnikova said. “Apolitical just means supporting players that are already in power.”U.S. Federal Reserve meetingAustralia House Price Index (Q1/QoQ/YoY)10 a.m. HKT/SGT(2 a.m. UTC): China industrial production (May/YoYIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Deep Crypto Sell-Off, Coinbase Layoffs, Celsius Pausing Withdrawals, All Eyes on Fed as Investors Fear What’s NextCrypto market capitalization fell by some 12% in the last 24 hours to nearly $970 billion on Monday morning amid fears over aggressive Federal Reserve rate hikes.

Coinbase slammed the brakes on hiring and announced it would be rescinding already-accepted job offers – despite earlier promises the Nasdaq-listed exchange would do no such thing.Despite the growing chill in the markets – or perhaps because of them – Consensus was a blowout.For four days, conference-goers ate, drank and were merry. They traversed the city on scooters in the Texas heat, bouncing between networking sessions and hackathons in various hotels to sessions in the Austin Convention Center (ACC), featuring some of the biggest names in crypto and culture including whistleblower Edward Snowden, FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and rapper 2 Chainz.Attendees eagerly collected DESK, CoinDesk’s social token, and used it to pay for tacos and barbecue from food trucks or Consensus-branded merchandise. At night, they swapped DESK for drink tokens at Consensus-affiliated after-parties, like the one headlined by electronic music duo Disclosure.Consensus-adjacent events including the Helium House ATX, sponsored by the rapidly-expanding Helium protocol, also thrived. Catered dinners and parties sponsored by companies such as Binance drew large crowds, and industry insiders rubbed elbows with regulators and investors at invite-only events, like lobbying group Coin Center’s annual dinner.In hindsight, Coin Center’s (seed oil-free, naturally) dinner seems more akin to a Last Supper, and its theme – inspired by the “This is Fine” meme, in which a dog in a tiny hat sips coffee in a burning room – feels prescient.On Sunday morning, Consensus 2022 wrapped up with a well-attended interview between CoinDesk’s Emily Parker and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. Zhao’s proclamations of having a “healthy war chest” to weather the coming crypto winter were met with cheers from the audience.Later that evening, crypto lending service Celsius halted its withdrawals and other products, sending the markets into a panic. On Monday, the price of bitcoin (BTC) plummeted, going as low as $20,834 in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Later on Tuesday, Coinbase announced mass layoffs, slashing nearly 20% of its workforce and leaving approximately 1,100 people without jobs.As the flurries of crypto winter turned into a blizzard, Consensus offered attendees a brief shelter from the storm, a warm hearth to gather around and meet friends, tell stories and plan for the future.The WAGMI (“we’re all going to make it”) optimism of the bull market is fading fast, but, hey – at least we had fun in Austin.CoinDesk’s social token, DESK, made its debut as a full-fledged blockchain token at this year’s Consensus.The beta version used at last year’s virtual Consensus – which could be obtained by visiting various sessions and exchanged for CoinDesk merch and non-fungible tokens (NFT) – was enormously popular, and developed a fanbase that named themselves “Piranhas” for their insatiable hunger for DESK.To appease the Piranhas in Austin, CoinDesk made DESK bigger than ever, bringing it from the experimental environment of Ethereum’s testnet to Polygon, a live blockchain, and offering in-person events to teach attendees how to redeem and use their DESK.DESK could be obtained by scanning QR codes posted around the conference, or completing quests given on the DESK Discord server, such as taking selfies in various places or shooting hoops at the Sport Court.Over 20% of Consensus attendees used DESK during the festival, collectively spending approximately 200,000 tokens on food, drinks and merch. Dozens of helpful volunteers in bright yellow DESK T-shirts swarmed the convention center, offering help to confused attendees.It wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows, though: Some would-be DESK Piranhas got greedy, tearing down QR code stickers from signs in an attempt to redeem more than their share and prevent others from getting DESK. Scammers printed fake “DESK multiplier” QR codes and stuck them to DESK posters, hoping to scam DESK users out of the contents of their wallets.Turns out that even if it’s just DESK, the old crypto adage of “Do Your Own Research” still applies.Consensus has always been an occasion for gimmicky spectacle – the 2018 event, which attracted roughly 8,000 attendees, famously featured several Lamborghinis that were parked out front of the conference.In Austin, however, the Lambos were absent, replaced with even more expensive McLarens. One, wrapped in a pattern of hundreds of overlapping DOGE Shiba inu faces, attracted a large crowd when its owner, crypto influencer Julia Love, parked it in front of the Hilton.The demo of “Crypto: the Musical” on June 10 was also a spectacle. The brainchild of Amanda Cassatt, CEO of crypto marketing firm Serotonin, the would-be Broadway show aims to tell the story of “one woman’s journey fleeing the corporate world to join a crypto startup.”The aspiring theatrical project’s creative team (who also produced “Ratatouille: the TikTok Musical”) and performers serenaded the audience with two songs from the show, including one about the Howey Test – a framework created by the U.S. Supreme Court to determine whether transactions qualify as securities.Consensus 2022 also featured the first MetaGala, a black-tie event where crypto investors, influencers and artists came together to drink (cocktails had themed names, such as the Metarita, the Meta Mule and the Meta Spritz), dance and raise money for several charities.Though this year’s Consensus was the first held in Austin after years in New York or virtually because of COVID-19, the Texas capital turned out to be a perfect fit for the festival.The spirit of Austin meshed well with crypto, and Consensus attendees embraced the entertainment and culture the city had to offer.When they weren’t buying food with DESK, attendees ate at famous local restaurants including the Texas Chili Parlor and Franklin’s Barbecue, they went to drag queen brunches on 4th Street, and they cooled off at Barton Springs – a spring-fed pool in Zilker Park beloved by locals for its notoriously cold water.On the final day of the conference, Austin Mayor Steve Adler joined CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael Casey to announce that Consensus will return to his city next year, although, to beat the 100-degree heat, it will be moved from June to late April.Though Austin was sweltering, Consensus-goers may miss the Texas heat after returning home to headlines about layoffs, price slumps and a once-highflying lender’s potential insolvency.Consensus was a respite from the cold – and, hopefully for many, a fortification. Now it’s over. Crypto winter is here. Bundle up.The S&P; 500 has rallied to snap a five-session losing skid after a policy announcement by the Federal Reserve that raised interest rates to market expectations as the US central bank seeks to fight rising inflation without sparking a recession.The Federal Reserve raised its target interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point - its biggest rate hike since 1994 - and projected a slowing economy and rising unemployment in the months to come.After a week of announcements in NSW to improve the affordability of childcare and early learning, today Victorian parents are getting a turn.

Nearly half of users said they did not own crypto but plan to buy digital assets in the near future, and the most commonly reported transaction size for both buys and sells was under $25.Those who reported owning cryptocurrencies listed price appreciation, portfolio diversification, and interest in technology and being part of a community as key reasons for holding.Paypal (PYPL) and Coinbase (COIN) were the most widely used exchanges, BofA found, with 53% and 46% of people using these platforms, respectively.Coinbase, however, was listed as the most preferred exchange among all users, and 47% of existing crypto users listed the platform as their favorite among all services. For users who hadn't yet purchased crypto but plan to over the next six months, PayPal was listed as the most preferred service.Block's Cash App (SQ), Robinhood (HOOD), and Crypto.com rounded out the top 5 exchanges for both existing and prospective users.Among existing crypto investors, 75% said they owned Bitcoin (BTC-USD) while 44% said they owned Ethereum (ETH-USD). About a quarter of existing crypto investors — 26% — said they owned meme coins such as Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) or Shiba Inu (SHIB-USD).For existing crypto investors, ""I think the price will go up"" was cited as the most popular reason for investing in cryptocurrencies.This reported interest in crypto comes amid a deepening sell-off in the space as investors brace for aggressive action from the Federal Reserve to fight inflation.Bitcoin, the largest digital cryptocurrency, extended its slide Tuesday to dip below $22,000, its lowest price level since 2020. Meanwhile, Ethereum — the second-largest digital coin — fell beneath its 2018 peak price of $1,396 and was trading below $1,200 Tuesday morning.—Alexandra Semenova is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

87,"Cryptocurrency sell-offs continued through Tuesday morning, with drawdowns waning after the sector’s “Black Monday” saw over $1 billion in crypto derivatives liquidated over a 24 hour period according to data from Coinglass.Overall, the total crypto market cap has lost more than two-thirds of its value since peaking in November, according to Coinmarketcap, falling from $3 trillion at its apex to $952 billion as of Tuesday 11 am New York time.After briefly dipping to $20,950 per unit early Tuesday morning, the bitcoin (BTC-USD) price has settled at $22,652, a loss of 5.2% in the last 24 hours according to Coinmarketcap.Meanwhile, ether (ETH-USD) trades at $1,236 per coin, a 1.31% gain on the day after seeing some of the worst losses of major cryptocurrencies Sunday through Monday.According to DeFi Llama, the total market capitalization of stablecoins is currently $158 billion, down 16.4% from its May 1 peak of $189 billion, a 1% loss on the day.Analysts remain extremely cautious as investors await the Federal Reserve’s Wednesday FOMC meeting and press conference.“If Wall Street gets a very hawkish decision and press conference, Treasury yields and the dollar could surge once again and that would test the line in the sand many crypto traders have drawn,” noted Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.“If Bitcoin breaks below the $20,000 level, support might not emerge until the $17,000 level. Another crypto plunge might not see major support until the 2019 summer high around the $14,000 level,” Moya went on to say.Also drawing headlines on Tuesday was an announcement from Coinbase (COIN) that the company would be laying off 1,100 employees, or 18% of its workforce, in a bid to remain financially sound.“We appear to be entering a recession after a 10+ year economic boom,"" Coinbase founder and CEO Brian Armstrong said this morning in a blog post. ""A recession could lead to another crypto winter, and could last for an extended period. In past crypto winters, trading revenue (our largest revenue source) has declined significantly.""The major crypto exchange is the latest of crypto firms announcing layoffs including competitor exchanges Gemini and Crypto.com as well as the lender BlockFi, which have all named “crypto winter” as the primary reason for the cuts.In addition to the Fed announcement, traders are also waiting for more clarity on issues related to Celsius Network’s solvency, Noelle Acheson, head of insights with Genesis Trading told Yahoo Finance.Since pausing withdrawals Sunday evening, the crypto lender has “become a forced seller of other assets” according to Acheson.“The market is still digesting what this could mean,” she said, adding that even if the firm reopens withdrawals, Celsius could see a wave of redemptions that could trigger further selling.Here's a roundup of other crypto movers.Major cryptocurrencies such as Solana (SOL-USD), up about 6%, Cardano’s ADA token (ADA-USD), up around 4%, Chainlink (LINK-USD), up 15%, Polkadot's DOT token (DOT-USD), up 5%, and Avalanche's AVAX token (AVAX-USD), up 1%, have all seen gains on the day.Like bitcoin, sell offs continue for Binance's BNB token (BNB-USD) down 1%, Tron (TRX-USD), down 9%, and Polygon's MATIC token (MATIC-USD), down over 3%.—David Hollerith covers cryptocurrency for Yahoo Finance.
