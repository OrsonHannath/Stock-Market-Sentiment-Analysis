35,"The new norm for the stock market after a wild May, according to top strategist Liz Ann Sonders at Charles Schwab, may bear market rallies: i.e., large rallies followed by larger drops that keep markets in a broader decline.""For now,"" Sonders told Yahoo Finance Live on if investors should be bracing for more bear rallies ahead (video above). ""We did with the rally that we saw last week, you saw some improvement in breadth. You did see some shorter term technical triggers suggesting that there could be legs to the rally. But the kind of significant breadth thrusts as they're called... we didn't quite get that.""The S&P 500 index ended a seven-week losing streak last week and posted its best week since Nov. 2020, rising by more than 6.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite tacked on 4.2% and 5.2%, respectively.But on the Tuesday after the long Memorial Day weekend, the S&P 500 fell 0.6% in a choppy session as traders locked in on the rampant inflation narrative as President Biden met with Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The Dow dropped 0.7% and the Nasdaq slipped 0.4%.On Wednesday, the choppiness continued as stocks fell despite an upbeat quarter and outlook from tech bellwether Salesforce.Observers assigned the pullback to weak manufacturing data that was quickly followed by headlines created by JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who said at Bernstein's Strategic Decisions Conference the U.S. economy is facing a ""hurricane"" as the Federal Reserve continues its process of normalizing interest rates.So far in 2022, the Nasdaq is down more than 20% — so technically in a bear market — while the S&P is down more than 13% and the Dow is down nearly 10%.Sonders said investors need to be extra vigilant in this type of volatile backdrop, where headlines such as those from Dimon could rattle already nervous markets.""What we saw last week is what you tend to see in bear markets,"" Sonders said. ""Trading around them is certainly a possibility. I just think for shorter term investors, rallies look a little more ripe for trimming into then sell-offs look ripe for adding risk in portfolios.""Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

CRM need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jun 17, 2022 $110 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Salesforce shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Salesforce is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Computer - Software industry that ranks in the Bottom  30% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.12 per share to $1.11 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Salesforce right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

Sri Lanka-based Teejay counts PVH Corp. -- the parent company of fashion brands Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein -- as its top customer, according to its annual report.Still, Teejay faces challenges in a key market and in its home country. A slowdown in the US economy is expected to impact retail sales of “large apparel companies, and its effects will be seen in the global supply chain, including in Sri Lanka,” later this year, Premaratne said.In Sri Lanka, suffering its worst economic crisis, inflation accelerated more than expected to a record 39.1% in May amid continuing food, medicine and fuel shortages, while citizens have also had to endure daily power outages of as much as 13 hours.Teejay is coping by using generators during the electricity cuts to ensure uninterrupted operations.“Already fuel has gone up, electricity prices are expected to be raised, which will add to cost,” Premaratne said.For now, the local currency’s depreciation is expected to offset the rupee cost increase, thereby “keeping the overheads intact at a dollar level.”Brokerage First Capital, while retaining a buy on the stock, downgraded earnings for the financial year ending March 2023 to 3.6 billion rupees ($10 million), and for the year after to 5.7 billion rupees, considering higher commodity prices and the resultant impact on margins.“We expect yarn prices to gradually stabilize by the beginning of FY24 while increased focus towards the high margin synthetic fabric by TJL and enhanced market share through increased volumes to cushion the negative impact stemming from cost pressures,” Hiruni Perera, an analyst at First Capital, wrote in a note.Teejay Lanka reported a net income of 826.2 million rupees for the fourth quarter, up 8.6% from the year ago period.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekChina Youth Unemployment Crisis Leaves Tens of Millions JoblessSeven Ways to Beat Burnout and Get Your Career Back on TrackFor Finland, a Border With Russia Is Bad.

(NYSE:NKE) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for NIKE We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:2022202320242025202620272028202920302031 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.27bUS$6.13bUS$8.13bUS$8.60bUS$9.47bUS$10.1bUS$10.6bUS$11.0bUS$11.4bUS$11.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x12Analyst x11Analyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ 4.85%Est @ 3.97%Est @ 3.36%Est @ 2.92% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.3% US$5.0kUS$5.4kUS$6.8kUS$6.7kUS$7.0kUS$7.0kUS$6.9kUS$6.7kUS$6.6kUS$6.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$64bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.9%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2031 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$12b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (6.3%– 1.9%) = US$270bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$270b÷ ( 1 + 6.3%)10= US$146bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$210b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$119, the company appears about fair value at a 11% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at NIKE as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.044. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For NIKE, we've put together three further factors you should further research:Financial Health: Does NKE have a healthy balance sheet?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Eli Lilly and Company (LLY), ConocoPhillips (COP), and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>Eli Lilly shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+59.6 % vs. +26.0%) on the back of Lilly's solid portfolio of core drugs in diabetes, autoimmune diseases and cancer. Lilly’s revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Trulicity, Taltz, and others. It is regularly adding promising new pipeline assets through business development deals. It has an exciting pipeline of potential new medicines including tirzepatide for type II diabetes and donanemab for early Alzheimer's disease. Both candidates have multibillion-dollar sales potential.However, generic competition for several drugs, rising pricing pressure in the United States mainly on key drug, Trulicity, and price cuts in some international markets like China, Japan and Europe are some top-line headwinds.(You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here >>>)ConocoPhillips shares have modestly outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry over the past year (+96.1% vs. +89.5%). The company holds a bulk of acres in the unconventional plays of Eagle Ford shale, Permian Basin and Bakken shale. The Zacks analyst believes that significant opportunities are there for the firm in the Bakken Shale, where it owns about 750 undrilled locations that could provide access to huge reserves.Notably, the company has revised its expected 2022 return of capital to shareholders upward to $10 billion, reflecting an increase from the prior-mentioned $8 billion. COP projects its 2022 production at 1.76 MMBoe/d, suggesting an improvement from 1.6 MMBoe/d reported last year. Also, the company’s balance sheet is significantly less leveraged than the industry it belongs to. Its massive liquidity position will enable it to pay off the short-term debt of $1,160 million. Given these tailwinds, ConocoPhillips is considered a preferred energy firm to own now.(You can read the full research report ConocoPhillips here >>>)PNC shares have declined -8.0% over the past year against the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry’s decline of -12.4%. The Zacks analyst believes that mounting expenses will likely keep denting the bottom line in the near term. Though the Fed has hiked interest rates and signaled more hikes this year, the overall low interest rate environment might strain the bank’s net interest margin (NIM) in the near term. The lack of diversification in the loan portfolio is concerning.However, Economic growth and robust pipelines are expected to support loan and deposit balances, aiding its balance sheet. Planned investments in inorganic expansion strategies will strengthen its banking franchise and diversify its business mix. Sound capital deployment activities are other positives.(You can read the full research report on PNC here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Equinix, Inc. (EQIX), Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW), and Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX). Sheraz Mian Director of Research Note: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

However, stiff competition is expected to unfavorably impact its pricing power.Edwards (EW) Rides on Solid TAVR Arm Growth Amid Forex WoesThe Zacks analyst is impressed with Edwards's TAVR segment growth in the first-quarter 2022 led by increased adoption of the SAPIEN 3 Ultra platform. Foreign exchange woes remain a concern.Exploration Progress, Debt Reduction to Aid Freeport (FCX)Per the Zacks analyst, Freeport will gain from its progress in exploration activities to expand production capacity and efforts to deleverage balance sheet amid headwind from higher costs.Marathon (MPC) Gains from Sale of Speedway Retail UnitThe Zacks analyst likes Marathon's sale of Speedway business, which provided a much-needed cash infusion and came with a supply agreement ensuring a steady revenue stream.AIG Benefits From Strong Revenues and Cost-Control MeasuresPer the Zacks analyst, higher premiums combined with rate hikes in the Commercial lines business are driving revenues. Cost-saving efforts are aiding margins.CrowdStrike (CRWD) Rides on Product Strength, AcquisitionsPer the Zacks analyst, CrowdStrike is gaining from solid contributions of its growth-oriented products, primarily Falcon platform. Also, strategic buyouts like SecureCircle and Humio are a positive.Western Digital (WDC) Gains from Higher Demand for StoragePer the Zacks analyst, Western Digital's performance is being driven by higher demand from cloud customers especially for nearline products. Supply chain woes and higher costs remain headwinds.New UpgradesW.R. Berkley (WRB) Set to Grow on Solid Insurance BusinessPer the Zacks analyst, W.R. Berkley's Insurance business is set to grow on rate increases, reserving discipline, and improving premiums from international unit supported by the emerging markets.Business Transformation Plan Benefits Louisiana-Pacific (LPX)Per the Zacks analyst, solid housing and repair/remodel activity, strategic business transformation, effective cash management and inorganic moves have been benefiting Louisiana-Pacific.Nexeo Buyout, Productivity Actions Aid Univar (UNVR)Per the Zacks analyst, Univar will benefit from significant synergies of the Nexeo Solutions acquisition. Its cost and productivity improvement actions should also lend support to margins.New DowngradesUrban Outfitters (URBN) Witnesses Supply-Chain & Other IssuesPer the Zacks analyst, Urban Outfitters has been battling supply-chain challenges. In addition, inflationary pressures from inbound freight costs and raw materials have been hurting performance.Rising Inflation & Supply Chain Woes Ails Hibbett (HIBB) Per the Zacks analyst, Hibbett has been reeling under supply-chain issues, rising inflation, the absence of stimulus and geopolitical challenges. These factors are likely to hurt FY23 results.Wildfire expenses and weak solvency impacts PG&E Corp (PCG)Per the Zacks Analyst, higher wildfire mitigation expenses might weigh on the company's operational results in the coming days. Also, its weak solvency position remains a bottleneck.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Shares have lost about 14.7% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Outfront Media due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.OUTFRONT Media Q1 FFO Beats Estimates, Revenues Up Y/YOUTFRONT Media reported first-quarter 2022 adjusted funds from operations AFFO per share of 23 cents. The figure marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents.The company’s first-quarter results reflect a rise in revenues, partially offset by higher operating expenses.The quarterly revenues of $373.5 million outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $366.9 million. On a year-over-year basis, revenues increased 44.1% from $259.2 million.According to Jeremy Male, chairman and CEO of OUTFRONT Media, ""Q1 was another strong quarter, with total revenues up 44% year-over-year. High demand for our billboards, both static and digital, drove U.S. Billboard revenues up to levels nearly 20% above 2019.""During the reported quarter, billboard revenues were $298.2 million, marking year-over-year growth of 33.4%. The upside resulted from higher average revenues per display (referred to as yield) compared with the prior-year quarter.The company’s transit and other revenues of $75.3 million more than doubled from $35.6 million reported a year ago. The upswing mainly resulted from the increase in yield compared with the prior-year period.OUTFRONT Media’s operating income totaled $28.5 million in the first quarter against a deficit of $31 million a year ago.Operating expenses were $212.8 million, up 19.8% year over year. The rise was primarily due to costs associated with higher billboard and transit revenues. Also, higher guaranteed minimum annual payments to the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority were a contributing factor.Net cash flow provided by operating activities in the quarter ended Mar 31, 2022, was $20.5 million against net cash flow used for operating activities of $10.8 million during the prior-year period.As of Mar 31, 2022, OUTFRONT Media’s liquidity position comprised unrestricted cash of $355.7 million and $495.9 million of availability under its $500-million revolving credit facility, net of $4.1 million of issued letters of credit. In the quarter under review, the company sold no shares under its at-the-market (ATM) equity program and had $232.5 million available under the ATM program at the quarter’s end.As of Mar 31, 2022, the company’s total debt was $2.7 billion, excluding $26.4 million of debt issuance costs. It included a $600 million term loan and $2.1 billion of senior unsecured notes.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted 7.95% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Outfront Media has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a C. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise Outfront Media has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerOutfront Media is part of the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry. Over the past month, American Tower (AMT), a stock from the same industry, has gained 6.3%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended March 2022 more than a month ago.American Tower reported revenues of $2.66 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +23.3%. EPS of $1.56 for the same period compares with $2.46 a year ago.American Tower is expected to post earnings of $2.45 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.2%.

120,"– Data from 75 patients with transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia or severe sickle cell disease with follow-up of up to 37.2 months continue to demonstrate that exa-cel has the potential to be a one-time functional cure –– Safety profile generally consistent with myeloablative conditioning and autologous stem cell transplant –BOSTON & ZUG, Switzerland & CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 11, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (Nasdaq: VRTX) and CRISPR Therapeutics (Nasdaq: CRSP) announce presentation of new data on exa-cel, formerly known as CTX001™, from CLIMB-111, CLIMB-121 and CLIMB-131 highlighting the potentially transformative profile of this investigational therapy for people with transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT) or severe sickle cell disease (SCD) and provided additional program updates.New Data for exa-cel from CLIMB Clinical StudiesThe data presented at the European Hematology Association (EHA) Congress are from 75 patients (44 with TDT and 31 with SCD) with follow-up ranging from 1.2 to 37.2 months after exa-cel dosing.Of the 44 patients with TDT, 26 had beta-zero/beta-zero or other beta-zero-like severe genotypes. Forty-two of 44 patients with TDT were transfusion-free with follow-up ranging from 1.2 to 37.2 months after exa-cel infusion. Two patients who were not yet transfusion-free had 75% and 89% reductions in transfusion volume. TDT patients had substantial mean increases in fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and corresponding increases in mean total hemoglobin (Hb) with mean total Hb levels increasing to >11 g/dL by Month 3 and maintained thereafter.All 31 patients with severe SCD characterized by recurrent vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) (mean of 3.9 VOCs per year over the prior two years) were free of VOCs after exa-cel infusion through duration of follow-up, with follow-up ranging from 2.0 to 32.3 months. SCD patients had mean HbF (as a proportion of total Hb) of approximately 40% by Month 4 and maintained thereafter.The safety was generally consistent with myeloablative conditioning with busulfan and autologous stem cell transplant. All patients engrafted neutrophils and platelets after exa-cel infusion. Among the 44 patients with TDT, two patients had serious adverse events (SAEs) considered related to exa-cel. As previously reported, one patient had three SAEs considered related to exa-cel, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), acute respiratory distress syndrome and headache, and one SAE of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome that was considered related to both exa-cel and busulfan. All four SAEs occurred in the context of HLH and have resolved. One patient had SAEs of delayed neutrophil engraftment and thrombocytopenia, both of which were considered related to exa-cel and busulfan, and both SAEs have resolved. Among the 31 patients with SCD, there were no SAEs considered related to exa-cel.Additional details were presented during the EHA media briefing and can be found in the published abstract and presentation.Late-breaking abstract #LB2367 entitled ""Efficacy and Safety of a Single Dose of CTX001 For Transfusion-Dependent Βeta-Thalassemia and Severe Sickle Cell Disease,"" will be an oral presentation on Sunday, June 12 at 09:45-11:15 CEST.""These robust data from 75 patients, of which 33 have one year or more of follow-up after exa-cel infusion, further demonstrate the potential of this investigational therapy as a one-time functional cure for patients with transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia or severe sickle cell disease,"" said Carmen Bozic, M.D., Executive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Officer at Vertex.""By reactivating a naturally occurring developmental process, exa-cel restores fetal hemoglobin production and thereby can ameliorate the course of these diseases,"" said Haydar Frangoul, M.D., Medical Director of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology at Sarah Cannon Research Institute, HCA Healthcare’s The Children’s Hospital at TriStar Centennial Medical Center. ""The remarkable results based on this approach give me great optimism and confidence in the potential of this treatment for patients.""""I have seen first-hand the impact that this investigational therapy has had on patients in these clinical trials and continue to be impressed by the totality of the data,"" said Franco Locatelli, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Pediatrics at the Sapienza University of Rome, Director of the Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology at Bambino Gesù Children’s Hospital. ""Given the urgency for highly effective and curative therapies for patients with hemoglobinopathies, I am excited to be part of the team working towards the goal of addressing this unmet need.""Exa-cel Study UpdatesFollowing ongoing discussions with regulators, the clinical trial protocols for CLIMB-111 and CLIMB-121 were amended to incorporate feedback on the primary endpoints for regulatory submission. Specifically, the primary endpoint in CLIMB-111 for TDT has been amended from proportion of subjects achieving transfusion reduction after exa-cel infusion to proportion of subjects maintaining weighted average Hb ≥9 g/dL without red blood cell (RBC) transfusions for at least 12 consecutive months after exa-cel infusion.The primary endpoint in CLIMB-121 for SCD has been updated from proportion of subjects with HbF ≥20% after exa-cel infusion, to proportion of subjects who have not experienced any severe VOCs for at least 12 consecutive months after exa-cel infusion.Both clinical trials are now in Phase 3 and are fully enrolled. All patients will have the opportunity to join CLIMB-131, a long-term follow-up study, after completing participation in the initial studies.Additional Pediatric StudiesIn line with the company’s strategy of developing therapies for patients of all ages, two additional Phase 3 studies of exa-cel have begun. Earlier this year, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) met to review the data in adults and adolescents and endorsed expanding into younger pediatric patients. CLIMB-141 and CLIMB-151 are Phase 3 open-label trials designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a single dose of exa-cel in patients ages 2 to 11 years with TDT or SCD, respectively. The trials are now open for enrollment and currently enrolling patients ages 5 to 11 years and will plan to extend to patients 2 to less than 5 years of age at a later date. Each trial will enroll approximately 12 patients. Patients will be followed for approximately two years after infusion. Each patient will be asked to participate in CLIMB-131, a long-term follow-up trial.Vertex also presented three additional abstracts on the burden of disease in sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia at the EHA Congress.Abstract #P1704 entitled ""Projected Lifetime Economic Burden of Severe Sickle Cell Disease in the United States,"" presented via poster on Friday, June 10 at 16:30-17:45 CEST.Abstract #P1703 entitled ""Economic Burden of Transfusion-Dependent Beta-Thalassemia in the United States,"" presented via poster on Friday, June 10 at 16:30-17:45 CEST.Abstract #P1482 entitled ""Patients With Severe Sickle Cell Disease on Standard-of-Care Treatment Are Very Unlikely to Become VOC-Free for One Year: A Cohort Study of Medicaid Enrollees,"" presented via poster on Friday, June 10 at 16:30-17:45 CEST.About exagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel)Exa‑cel, formerly known as CTX001, is an investigational, autologous, ex vivo CRISPR/Cas9 gene‑edited therapy that is being evaluated for patients with TDT or SCD characterized by recurrent VOCs, in which a patient’s own hematopoietic stem cells are edited to produce high levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF; hemoglobin F) in red blood cells. HbF is the form of the oxygen‑carrying hemoglobin that is naturally present during fetal development, which then switches to the adult form of hemoglobin after birth. The elevation of HbF by exa‑cel has the potential to alleviate transfusion requirements for patients with TDT and reduce painful and debilitating sickle crises for patients with SCD. Earlier results from these ongoing trials were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in January of 2021.Based on progress in this program to date, exa‑cel has been granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT), Fast Track, Orphan Drug, and Rare Pediatric Disease designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for both TDT and SCD. Exa-cel has also been granted Orphan Drug Designation from the European Commission, as well as Priority Medicines (PRIME) designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), for both TDT and SCD.Among gene‑editing approaches being evaluated for TDT and SCD, exa‑cel is the furthest advanced in clinical development.About CLIMB‑111 and CLIMB‑121The ongoing Phase 1/2/3 open‑label trials, CLIMB‑111 and CLIMB‑121, are designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a single dose of exa‑cel in patients ages 12 to 35 years with TDT or with SCD, characterized by recurrent VOCs, respectively. The trials are now closed for enrollment. Patients will be followed for approximately two years after exa‑cel infusion. Each patient will be asked to participate in CLIMB‑131, a long‑term follow‑up trial.About CLIMB-131This is a long‑term, open‑label trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of exa‑cel in patients who received exa‑cel in CLIMB‑111, CLIMB‑121, CLIMB‑141 or CLIMB‑151. The trial is designed to follow participants for up to 15 years after exa‑cel infusion.About CLIMB‑141 and CLIMB‑151The ongoing Phase 3 open-label trials, CLIMB‑141 and CLIMB‑151, are designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a single dose of exa‑cel in patients ages 2 to 11 years with TDT or with SCD, characterized by recurrent VOCs, respectively. The trials are now open for enrollment and currently enrolling patients ages 5 to 11 years of age and will plan to extend to patients 2 to less than 5 years of age at a later date. Each trial will enroll approximately 12 patients. Patients will be followed for approximately two years after infusion. Each patient will be asked to participate in CLIMB-131, a long‑term follow‑up trial.About the Gene‑Editing Process in These TrialsPatients who enroll in these trials will have their own hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells collected from peripheral blood. The patient’s cells will be edited using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The edited cells, exa‑cel, will then be infused back into the patient as part of an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), a process which involves a patient being treated with myeloablative busulfan conditioning. Patients undergoing HSCT may also encounter side effects (ranging from mild to severe) that are unrelated to the administration of exa‑cel. Patients will initially be monitored to determine when the edited cells begin to produce mature blood cells, a process known as engraftment. After engraftment, patients will continue to be monitored to track the impact of exa‑cel on multiple measures of disease and for safety.About the Vertex‑CRISPR CollaborationVertex and CRISPR Therapeutics entered into a strategic research collaboration in 2015 focused on the use of CRISPR/Cas9 to discover and develop potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human disease. Exa‑cel represents the first potential treatment to emerge from the joint research program.

This first interim analysis of an ongoing five-year post-authorization study (abstract WS22.05) showed that real-world treatment with TRIKAFTA® was associated with improved lung function and a 77% reduced risk of pulmonary exacerbations compared to pre-TRIKAFTA® baseline, as well as an 87% lower risk of lung transplant and a 74% lower risk of death, compared to the historical 2019 U.S. CFFPR population. No new safety concerns were identified.Vertex will also present data comparing the annual rate of lung function change in people with CF ages 12 years and older with two F508del mutations (F/F) or one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation (F/MF) treated with TRIKAFTA® in pivotal studies and an open-label extension study compared to propensity-score matched historical CFTR-modulator-untreated controls from the U.S. CFFPR (abstract WS22.04). Results show that TRIKAFTA® demonstrated on average no decrease in ppFEV1 over a two-year period in this population, in contrast to declines seen in the matched controls. The analysis indicates that treatment with TRIKAFTA® has a significant impact on the trajectory of CF lung disease.Additionally, Vertex will present data from a long-term real-world study demonstrating that initiating KALYDECO® (ivacaftor) early in life (ages 6-10 years) preserves lung function to a greater extent than if KALYDECO® is initiated at an older age (abstract WS17.03). These results show the importance of early initiation of KALYDECO® for eligible patients.""These long-term and real-world studies show the potentially transformative benefits of treatment with CFTR modulators and add to the substantial body of evidence supporting treatment as early in life as possible,"" said Carmen Bozic, M.D., Executive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Officer at Vertex. ""We continue to make rapid progress in developing medicines that treat the underlying cause of CF, and today, we are closer to our goal of developing highly effective therapies for all patients with CF than ever before.""Additional PresentationsIn addition to the studies noted above, other Vertex presentations at the conference this year support the long-term and early use of CFTR modulators:Abstract WS08.04 — Results of real-world study in people with CF with select residual function mutations, treated with KALYDECO® (ivacaftor)Abstract WS17.02 — Results from an ORKAMBI® (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) exploratory phase 2 open-label extension study in children with CF ages 2-5About Cystic FibrosisCystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare, life-shortening genetic disease affecting more than 83,000 people globally. CF is a progressive, multi-organ disease that affects the lungs, liver, pancreas, GI tract, sinuses, sweat glands and reproductive tract. CF is caused by a defective and/or missing CFTR protein resulting from certain mutations in the CFTR gene. Children must inherit two defective CFTR genes — one from each parent — to have CF, and these mutations can be identified by a genetic test. While there are many different types of CFTR mutations that can cause the disease, the vast majority of people with CF have at least one F508del mutation. CFTR mutations lead to CF by causing the CFTR protein to be defective or by leading to a shortage or absence of CFTR protein at the cell surface. The defective function and/or absence of CFTR protein results in poor flow of salt and water into and out of the cells in a number of organs. In the lungs, this leads to the buildup of abnormally thick, sticky mucus, chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage that eventually leads to death for many patients. The median age of death is in the early 30s.About TRIKAFTA® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor)In people with certain types of mutations in the CFTR gene, the CFTR protein is not processed or folded normally within the cell, and this can prevent the CFTR protein from reaching the cell surface and functioning properly. TRIKAFTA® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor) is an oral medicine designed to increase the quantity and function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. Elexacaftor and tezacaftor work together to increase the amount of mature protein at the cell surface by binding to different sites on the CFTR protein. Ivacaftor, which is known as a CFTR potentiator, is designed to facilitate the ability of CFTR proteins to transport salt and water across the cell membrane. The combined actions of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor help hydrate and clear mucus from the airways.TRIKAFTA® is a prescription medicine used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who have at least one copy of the F508del mutation, or another mutation responsive to TRIKAFTA®, in the CFTR gene. Patients should talk to their doctor to learn if they have an indicated CF gene mutation. It is not known if TRIKAFTA® is safe and effective in children under 6 years of age.Please see Important Safety Information below and [click here] for full U.S. Prescribing Information.About KALYDECO® (ivacaftor)In people with certain types of mutations in the CFTR gene, the CFTR protein at the cell surface does not function properly. Known as a CFTR potentiator, ivacaftor is an oral medicine designed to facilitate the ability of CFTR proteins to transport salt and water across the cell membrane, which helps hydrate and clear mucus from the airways. KALYDECO® (ivacaftor) was the first medicine to treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF) in people with specific mutations in the CFTR gene.KALYDECO® is a prescription medicine used for the treatment of CF in patients aged 4 months and older who have at least one mutation in their CF gene that is responsive to KALYDECO®. Patients should talk to their doctor to learn if they have an indicated CF gene mutation. It is not known if KALYDECO® is safe and effective in children under 4 months of age.Please see Important Safety Information below and [click here] for full U.S. Prescribing Information.About ORKAMBI® (lumacaftor/ivacaftor)In people with two copies of the F508del mutation, the CFTR protein is not processed and trafficked normally within the cell, resulting in little to no CFTR protein at the cell surface.ORKAMBI® (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) is an oral medicine that is a combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor. Lumacaftor is designed to increase the amount of mature protein at the cell surface by targeting the processing and trafficking defect of the F508del-CFTR protein. Ivacaftor, which is known as a CFTR potentiator, is designed to facilitate the ability of CFTR proteins to transport salt and water across the cell membrane. The combined actions of lumacaftor and ivacaftor help hydrate and clear mucus from the airways.ORKAMBI® is a prescription medicine used for the treatment of CF in patients age 2 years and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation (F508del/F508del) in their CFTR gene. ORKAMBI® should only be used in these patients. It is not known if ORKAMBI® is safe and effective in patients under 2 years of age.Please see Important Safety Information below and [click here] for full U.S. Prescribing Information.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION for TRIKAFTA (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor), KALYDECO (ivacaftor), and ORKAMBI (lumacaftor/ivacaftor)Patients should not take KALYDECO or TRIKAFTA if they take certain medicines or herbal supplements, such as: the antibiotics rifampin or rifabutin; seizure medicines such as phenobarbital, carbamazepine, or phenytoin; or St. John’s wort.Patients should not take ORKAMBI if they take certain medicines or herbal supplements, such as: the antibiotics rifampin or rifabutin; the seizure medicines phenobarbital, carbamazepine, or phenytoin; the sedatives and anti-anxiety medicines triazolam or midazolam; the immunosuppressant medicines cyclosporine, everolimus, sirolimus, or tacrolimus; or St. John’s wort.Before taking KALYDECO, ORKAMBI, or TRIKAFTA patients should tell their doctor about all of their medical conditions, including if they: have or have had liver problems; have kidney problems; are pregnant or plan to become pregnant because it is not known if KALYDECO, ORKAMBI, or TRIKAFTA, will harm an unborn baby; or are breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed because it is not known if KALYDECO, ORKAMBI, or TRIKAFTA passes into breast milk. Before taking ORKAMBI, patients should tell their doctor if they have had an organ transplant, or if they are using a hormonal contraceptive including oral, injectable, transdermal, or implantable form as this should not be used as a method of birth control when taking ORKAMBI.KALYDECO, ORKAMBI, or TRIKAFTA may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how KALYDECO, ORKAMBI, or TRIKAFTA work. Therefore, the dose of KALYDECO, ORKAMBI, or TRIKAFTA may need to be adjusted when taken with certain medications. Patients should especially tell their doctor if they take antifungal medications such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, or fluconazole; or antibiotics such as telithromycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin.KALYDECO or TRIKAFTA can cause dizziness in some people who take it. Patients should not drive a car, use machinery, or do anything that needs them to be alert until they know how KALYDECO or TRIKAFTA affects them.When taking ORKAMBI, patients should tell their doctor if they stop taking ORKAMBI for more than 1 week as their doctor may need to change the dose of ORKAMBI or other medicines the patient is taking.Patients should avoid food or drink containing grapefruit while taking KALYDECO or TRIKAFTA.KALYDECO, ORKAMBI, and TRIKAFTA can cause serious side effects, such as:Liver damage and worsening of liver function in people taking TRIKAFTA with severe liver disease that can be serious and may require transplantation. Liver damage has also happened in people without liver disease.High liver enzymes in the blood have been reported in patients receiving KALYDECO, ORKAMBI, or TRIKAFTA. The patient's doctor will do blood tests to check their liver before starting treatment with KALYDECO, ORKAMBI, or TRIKAFTA; every 3 months during the first year of treatment; and every year while on treatment. For patients who have had high liver enzymes in the past, the doctor may do blood tests to check the liver more often. Patients should call their doctor right away if they have any of the following symptoms of liver problems: pain or discomfort in the upper right stomach (abdominal) area; yellowing of their skin or the white part of their eyes; loss of appetite; nausea or vomiting; or dark, amber colored urine.Worsening of liver function in people with severe liver disease taking ORKAMBI. The worsening of liver function can be serious or cause death. Talk to your doctor if you have been told you have liver disease as your doctor may need to adjust the dose of ORKAMBI.Breathing problems such as shortness of breath or chest tightness in patients when starting ORKAMBI, especially in patients who have poor lung function. If a patient has poor lung function, their doctor may monitor them more closely when starting ORKAMBI.An increase in blood pressure in some people receiving ORKAMBI. The patient’s doctor should monitor their blood pressure during treatment with ORKAMBI.Abnormality of the eye lens (cataract) in some children and adolescents treated with KALYDECO, ORKAMBI, or TRIKAFTA. If the patient is a child or adolescent, their doctor should perform eye examinations before and during treatment with KALYDECO, ORKAMBI, or TRIKAFTA to look for cataracts.The most common side effects of KALYDECO include headache; upper respiratory tract infection (common cold), which includes sore throat, nasal or sinus congestion, and runny nose; stomach (abdominal) pain; diarrhea; rash; nausea; and dizziness.The most common side effects of ORKAMBI include breathing problems, such as shortness of breath and chest tightness; nausea; diarrhea; fatigue; increase in a certain blood enzyme called creatinine phosphokinase; rash; gas; common cold, including sore throat, stuffy or runny nose; flu or flu-like symptoms; and irregular, missed, or abnormal periods (menses) and increase in the amount of menstrual bleeding. Additional side effects seen in children include cough with sputum, stuffy nose, headache, stomach pain, and increase in sputum.The most common side effects of TRIKAFTA include headache; diarrhea; upper respiratory tract infection (common cold), including stuffy and runny nose; stomach (abdominal) pain; inflamed sinuses; increase in liver enzymes; increase in a certain blood enzyme called creatine phosphokinase; rash; flu (influenza); and increase in blood bilirubin.These are not all the possible side effects of KALYDECO, ORKAMBI, or TRIKAFTA.

Lane and V. James Vena to Board of DirectorsMEMPHIS, Tenn., June 14, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX) today announced a series of long-planned business and corporate governance actions consistent with the Company’s efforts to drive long-term value creation for all stakeholders.Raj Subramaniam, FedEx Corp. President and Chief Executive Officer, said, ""Through decades of investments, innovation, and expertise, we have built a global portfolio that serves as the foundation of our competitive advantage. Our focus is to build on this foundation and continue creating long-term value for our stockholders.""Dividend IncreaseFollowing a detailed review, the FedEx Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.15 per share on its common stock. This represents a $0.40 per share, or 53 percent, increase from the previous dividend of $0.75. The dividend is payable on July 11, 2022, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 27, 2022.Michael C. Lenz, FedEx Corp. Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, added, ""The increased dividend we announced today is the culmination of our Board’s thoughtful efforts over many months to ensure that our capital allocation strategy reflects our confidence in the trajectory of the business and increases returns for our stockholders. We look forward to sharing more detail on our strategy and long-term objectives at our investor day later this month.""Executive Compensation Program EnhancementsThe Company also announced that its cash-based long-term incentive (LTI) program for fiscal 2023 through 2025 includes an additional performance metric tied to FedEx’s total shareholder return (TSR) relative to a broad market index. The LTI program also includes a capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue (CapEx/Revenue) performance metric. The CapEx/Revenue target metric in the new LTI program is lower than in prior years to align with FedEx’s capital plans for fiscal years 2023 through 2025, and the Company expects to further lower its capital intensity in subsequent years. These changes are specifically designed to make management compensation more directly tied to delivering outstanding TSR and long-term value creation.Board ChangesFedEx is also adding two highly qualified independent directors, Amy Lane and Jim Vena, to its Board effective immediately. These appointments were made in connection with a cooperation agreement with the D. E. Shaw group. A third independent director mutually agreed upon by the Company and the D. E. Shaw group will be added to the Board at a later date.With the addition of these directors and the anticipated retirement of Dr. Shirley Ann Jackson at the expiration of her term due to the mandatory retirement provision of the Company’s corporate governance guidelines, the FedEx Board will comprise 14 directors, 12 of whom will be independent, following the Company’s 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.FedEx also announced that the Board’s Audit Committee has been renamed the Audit and Finance Committee, and, in addition to its current responsibilities of overseeing financial, compliance, risk management, and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosures, will be responsible for reviewing the Company’s financial affairs, including capital structure, allocation, and returns. R. Brad Martin will continue to Chair the committee, and Amy Lane, Marvin R. Ellison, Kimberly A. Jabal, Joshua Cooper Ramo, and Jim Vena currently serve as members of the committee.""We are pleased to welcome Amy and Jim to the FedEx Board,"" Subramaniam said. ""They both possess skills and experience that will be valuable to the Board as we oversee the execution of our strategy and financial objectives. We appreciate the collaboration with the D. E. Shaw group, a long-time FedEx stockholder, with whom we have maintained an ongoing and constructive dialogue in reaching this agreement.""""We are appreciative of the constructive approach taken by Raj and the FedEx Board of Directors. We believe that today’s Board enhancements and changes to the executive compensation program position the Company well to deliver on its plan to drive significant value for all stockholders. We look forward to the Company further detailing its plans to enhance stockholder value at the investor day later this month,"" said Michael O’Mary, Managing Director at the D. E. Shaw group.FedEx also made Board committee changes previously in March 2022 to better reflect the committees’ areas of oversight and strengthen their alignment with the Company’s priorities and values. These include:The Nominating & Governance Committee was renamed the Governance, Safety, and Public Policy Committee to add oversight of safety strategies and programs and expand the committee’s oversight of political activities and expenditures and ESG programs;The Compensation Committee was renamed the Compensation and Human Resources Committee to better reflect the committee’s existing oversight of strategies related to diversity, equity, and inclusion, workforce, enterprise health care, and other key human resource management strategies; andThe Information Technology Oversight Committee was renamed the Cyber and Technology Oversight Committee to better reflect the committee’s focus on cyber and technology risk management.Under the terms of the cooperation agreement, the D. E. Shaw group has agreed to certain customary voting and standstill provisions.About Amy LaneAmy Lane currently serves as a director of NextEra Energy, Inc. and TJX Companies Inc.

And in their study titled Who Falls Prey to the Wolf of Wall Street?' Leuz et. al. found that it is 'quite common' for investors to lose money by buying into 'pump and dump' schemes.In contrast to all that, I prefer to spend time on companies like FedEx (NYSE:FDX), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now, I'm not saying that the stock is necessarily undervalued today; but I can't shake an appreciation for the profitability of the business itself. In comparison, loss making companies act like a sponge for capital - but unlike such a sponge they do not always produce something when squeezed. Check out our latest analysis for FedEx The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so share price follows earnings per share (EPS) eventually. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Over the last three years, FedEx has grown EPS by 13% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.I like to take a look at earnings before interest and (EBIT) tax margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. FedEx shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 6.1% to 9.0%, and revenue is growing. That's great to see, on both counts.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings, and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.In investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of FedEx's forecast profits?Since FedEx has a market capitalization of US$52b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a glittering mountain of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$4.0b. I would find that kind of skin in the game quite encouraging, if I owned shares, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience my success, or failure, with the stock.It means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but I find myself wondering if remuneration policies are shareholder friendly. Well, based on the CEO pay, I'd say they are indeed. I discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like FedEx, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$14m.The FedEx CEO received US$8.2m in compensation for the year ending . That comes in below the average for similar sized companies, and seems pretty reasonable to me. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when its reasonable that does give me a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.One positive for FedEx is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. Earnings growth might be the main game for FedEx, but the fun does not stop there. With a meaningful level of insider ownership, and reasonable CEO pay, a reasonable mind might conclude that this is one stock worth watching. You still need to take note of risks, for example - FedEx has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Although FedEx certainly looks good to me, I would like it more if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see insider buying, too, then this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying, could be exactly what you're looking for.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

Located a few miles north of the booming city of Austin, the raw parcel could be used for virtually anything given the state’s lenient land-use laws. So when the prominent Robinson family put the property on the market last year, there was strong interest from a range of real estate players, including home builders, private equity giant Blackstone Inc. and Prologis Inc., an industrial landlord that rents out warehouses across the country. But when the successful bidder emerged in October, it wasn’t a real estate firm. It was the world’s largest e-commerce company: Amazon.com Inc.Most Read from BloombergChina Says It May Have Detected Signals From Alien CivilizationsMusk, Tesla, SpaceX Are Sued for Alleged Dogecoin Pyramid Scheme'Drip Pricing' Is Turning Checkout Into a Nasty SurpriseTech Leads Gains as Traders Parse Fed’s Promise: Markets WrapBiden Signals US Can Avert Recession But Americans Are ‘Really Down’Starting about three years ago, the Seattle-based colossus quietly began searching for property in key US markets such as Southern California, Texas, Illinois, Florida and the Bay Area. Between 2020 and 2022, Amazon tripled the amount of built industrial space it owns in North America, according to company filings. Sometimes Amazon buys existing buildings, such as defunct call centers, but it also purchases bare land, of which the company acquired about 4,000 acres in the same period, says real estate researcher CoStar Group Inc. Amazon plans to use much of the real estate for a new generation of towering fulfillment centers that can store a wide variety of products close to customers in populous areas, according to people familiar with the strategy.Buying land is a major shift for Amazon, which historically relied on a handful of developers to find property, build fairly simple warehouses and rent them back to the company. Now Amazon is increasingly taking parts of the development process in-house, often bidding against long-time partners for the best space.It’s a potentially risky strategy that exposes Amazon to the vagaries of the industrial real estate market. The company also overbuilt during the pandemic and is saddled with too much warehouse space now that the surge in online shopping has decelerated. As a result, Amazon is looking to sublease space it doesn’t need and has slowed its warehouse expansion. “Like all companies, we’re adapting to the availability of real estate and location of our customer demand, and we’re also constantly evaluating our approach based on our financials,” spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a statement.But the company said there is no change in its long-term real estate strategy. Executives remain committed to securing land in the right locations to fulfill founder Jeff Bezos’ vision of making an online purchase as instantly gratifying as a trip to the store. If Amazon doesn’t keep marching closer to customers now, it could permanently surrender that proximity to retail competitors like Walmart Inc. that are just a short drive away.“There’s going to be something on the other side of all of this investment for the consumer,” said John Blackledge, an analyst at Cowen and Company LLC. “People will buy more on Amazon when they see they can get it in five hours instead of in two days.”Amazon has spent at least $2.2 billion acquiring land or properties slated for redevelopment in the past two years, according to CoStar, which says the estimate is conservative because some states, including Texas, don’t disclose purchase prices.In March 2020, the company shelled out $30 million for 63 acres in a bustling industrial area between San Diego and the US border with Mexico. Then it built a 130-foot (40-meter) tall, state-of-the-art facility that can process a large assortment of products for same-day shipping. The company was opening new logistics facilities at the rate of about one every 24 hours at the time, so few realized the transaction represented a departure from standard practice.Amazon had historically preferred not to tie up money in real estate. Bezos, keen to run the business like a startup for as long as possible, always had other plans for the cash, the people said. He liked to invest in potentially transformative, long-term bets—cloud-computing, the Alexa voice-activated platform, building a movie studio.Bezos’ aversion to buying property confounded some Amazon real estate executives, especially as the company matured and its needs shifted, according to people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to discuss an internal matter. Retail competitors like Walmart own most of their US stores, giving them more control and assets that appreciate. A real estate portfolio can be sold and leased back to help a company get through lean periods without giving up the use of the land. There were also concerns that Amazon sometimes left money on the table in its dealings with developers. Once Amazon signs a long-term lease, the property typically surges in value; the company often gets none of the upside despite paying rent for 20 years.Amazon’s push to get deliveries to customers the same day was an ideal moment to rethink Bezos’ strategy. The company needed industrial space close to customers where land is scarce and competition is fierce. Erecting boxes on vacant land in the rural outskirts no longer worked. Amazon had to cram more products into smaller urban lots, requiring it to build more specialized and expensive taller buildings. Industrial property in the shadow of big cities is increasingly scarce and desired by a jostling pack of players, from distribution companies like United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. to grocers, restaurant chains and car dealerships. The vacancy rate for industrial space is at an all-time low of 3.4% despite a construction spree fueled by pandemic-related demand.Buying land is risky. Developing it is even more so because Amazon itself must negotiate the local bureaucracy and politics. But executives feel they have no choice, according to people familiar with the strategy, because the new generation of fulfillment centers are several orders of magnitude more complicated than the 40-foot boxes currently dotted around the country.The new facilities can be 100 feet tall or more, are packed with state-of-the-art automation and require lots of electricity. Warehouse developers typically avoid projects that are too expensive and specialized, especially when space in 100-year-old brick warehouses can still fetch a premium in the right location. It’s easy enough to find a new tenant for a simple warehouse but much harder to re-lease a facility purpose-built to Amazon’s exacting specifications.The new facilities can cost twice as much to build as typical warehouses, which currently run about $200 per square foot. So Amazon is courting a new class of investor to help finance the expansion besides developers narrowly focused on building for profits. USAA Real Estate Co., Softbank Group Corp.’s Fortress Investment Group LLC and GLP Capital Partners LP are among the investment firms interested in financing Amazon’s expansion with transactions that more closely resemble corporate bonds than lease agreements.Unlike developers who worry whether the building will appeal to the next tenant, these investors focus more on the credit-worthiness of the borrower. They’re also often willing to accept a lower return—paid by Amazon over approximately 20 years—since the real estate can shelter profit from other investments from taxes, according to Eric Frankel, a commercial real estate consultant and director at Validus Capital. “These new warehouses are so specialized they’re more like manufacturing facilities,” he said. “So Amazon needs to find different financing partners.”Amazon doesn’t win every bidding war. The company lost the suburban Chicago headquarters for Allstate Corp. and a 100-acre parcel near Miami to industrial real estate firms, according to people familiar with the matter. But Amazon is prevailing often enough to upend longstanding relationships with companies that suddenly find themselves competing for the best land with a deep-pocketed rival. Amazon will still pay developers to oversee warehouse construction, but for a paltry fee in the $5 million range compared with profits of up to $50 million they made by converting vacant land into a brand new facility with Amazon as a tenant, according to people familiar with the matter.For developers, the new strategy makes dealing with Amazon more complicated. Many are hesitant to show the company land they’re hoping to acquire and then lease to the e-commerce giant, fearing that Amazon will decide to try and buy it, according to people familiar with the situation, who requested anonymity because they continue to deal with the company. As Amazon considers other strategies, including buying and developing parcels itself, says a person familiar with its strategy, the company has been abruptly scuttling deals. Over the last year, Amazon has backed out of dozens of proposed delivery centers, according to developers and brokers.“People are pissed off,” said one real estate developer who has done business with Amazon and had a recent deal fall through. “They’re just cutting their partners out who helped them get to where they are right now.” The company denied relations with developers have soured and said it needs them as partners as much as developers need Amazon.The question now is how Amazon will adapt a boom-era strategy to current economic conditions. Online sales growth is slowing, interest rates are rising, and some analysts expect a recession in the coming months. The company has already reduced the number of new multistory warehouses it plans to build in the coming years to about 10 from as many as 40, according to people familiar with the matter. “Our plans continue to evolve, and we’re unable to confirm future builds or launches,” spokesperson Nantel said.Executives also are debating whether to unload some of the real estate they don’t immediately need or hang on to it for the day that demand picks up again, the people said. Those who favor keeping all of the properties say it would be even more expensive and potentially impossible to secure the same space in the future. How the debate is resolved will depend in part on who Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy chooses to replace retail and logistics chief Dave Clark, who recently announced he was leaving to run logistics startup Flexport Inc. Clark’s successor will have to weigh the pitfalls of investing in faster delivery at a time consumers are starting to pull back.The 193-acre property Amazon bought last fall in Round Rock captures the potential promise and peril. On the one hand, building a next-generation warehouse near Austin would position the company to meet the needs of a fast-growing region for years to come. On the other, if a recession materializes and online sales growth continues to slow, Amazon could find itself stuck with a pricey piece of land.Already the company seems to be hedging its bets. Amazon was moving expeditiously toward building the new facility, hosting community meetings to win over local residents, and was slated to begin the permit application process this summer. Then, on May 19, an Amazon economic development manager told city officials the company was putting the project on hold indefinitely.“As mentioned in our recent earnings report, customer demand patterns have stabilized and this provides an opportunity to better match our capacity and demand,” Jessica Breaux wrote in an email. “We will re-engage with the city and neighboring community when the timeline for this site is more defined.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekSheryl Sandberg’s Wedding Expenses Are the Least of Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg ProblemsEthereum Mining Is Going Away, and Miners Are Not HappyHell Is a Cruise Ship at the Beginning of the PandemicThe Last Bear Market Was Short-Lived.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in DexCom's (NASDAQ:DXCM) returns on capital, so let's have a look.For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on DexCom is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.06 = US$261m ÷ (US$5.1b - US$711m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).So, DexCom has an ROCE of 6.0%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Medical Equipment industry average of 8.9%. Check out our latest analysis for DexCom Above you can see how the current ROCE for DexCom compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for DexCom.The fact that DexCom is now generating some pre-tax profits from its prior investments is very encouraging. The company was generating losses five years ago, but now it's earning 6.0% which is a sight for sore eyes. And unsurprisingly, like most companies trying to break into the black, DexCom is utilizing 1,349% more capital than it was five years ago. This can tell us that the company has plenty of reinvestment opportunities that are able to generate higher returns.On a related note, the company's ratio of current liabilities to total assets has decreased to 14%, which basically reduces it's funding from the likes of short-term creditors or suppliers. This tells us that DexCom has grown its returns without a reliance on increasing their current liabilities, which we're very happy with.In summary, it's great to see that DexCom has managed to break into profitability and is continuing to reinvest in its business. Since the stock has returned a staggering 310% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if DexCom can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.If you want to continue researching DexCom, you might be interested to know about the 2 warning signs that our analysis has discovered.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Record-high inflation compelled the Fed to turn ultra-hawkish with tighter liquidity control and a higher interest rate regime. Consequently, the blood bath in the technology sector has been visible year to date.However, in the first five months of this year, the valuation of this sector has been corrected significantly. The Technology Select Sector SPDR XLK — one of the 11 broad sectors of the S&P 500 Index — has tumbled 19.5% year to date. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index has plunged 23.3% year to date and is currently under bear market territory.Most of the tech behemoths have seen massive correction in stock prices and are currently available at attractive valuations. We have selected five such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank and solid potential for the rest of 2022. These companies are - Cadence Design Systems Inc. CDNS, GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. GFS, Analog Devices Inc. ADI, Roper Technologies Inc. ROP and Synopsys Inc. SNPS.The recent meltdown of the technology sector is a temporary phenomenon. The fundamentals of this sector are rock solid. We must not forget that the growing demand for hi-tech superior products has been a catalyst for the sector in an otherwise tough environment. A series of breakthroughs in 5G wireless network, cloud computing, predictive analysis, AI, self-driving vehicles, digital personal assistants and IoT, has given a boost to the overall space.The leading emerging markets of Asia, Latin America, Africa and some European countries are still way behind in using digital technology compared to the developed world. While mobile phone penetration is nearly 90% in these countries, a large number of people are still using phones with old features, since voice communication and not data serve most of their needs. Even those using smartphones, rarely utilize online digital features.  However, the outbreak of coronavirus quickly changed the lifestyle and lookout of these people. People were not entirely used to the digital platforms for their office work (work from home), ordering foods and other daily needs or transferring money and making payments. Moreover, online schooling, video conferencing and virtual networking have now become essential.The countries that are more digitized have been able to minimize their losses during the pandemic. These are major lessons to the other countries. Even those who are less inclined toward the digital technology and online platforms, either because they have to learn using smartphones or tablets or due to fear of data theft, are now feeling the massive advantage of the online platforms.We have narrowed our search to five U.S. tech giants (market capital > $30 billion) that are currently trading on the dip. These stocks have positive growth potential for the rest of 2022 and have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions within the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCadence Design Systems offers products and tools that help customers design electronic products.

And this is undeniably the key to success when it comes to short-term investing or trading. But it isn't easy to ensure the sustainability of a trend and profit from it.Often, the direction of a stock's price movement reverses quickly after taking a position in it, making investors incur a short-term capital loss. So, it's important to ensure that there are enough factors -- such as sound fundamentals, positive earnings estimate revisions, etc. -- that could keep the momentum in the stock going.Our ""Recent Price Strength"" screen, which is created on a unique short-term trading strategy, could be pretty useful in this regard. This predefined screen makes it really easy to shortlist the stocks that have enough fundamental strength to maintain their recent uptrend. Also, the screen passes only the stocks that are trading in the upper portion of their 52-week high-low range, which is usually an indicator of bullishness.Valero Energy (VLO) is one of the several suitable candidates that passed through the screen. Here are the key reasons why it could be a profitable bet for ""trend"" investors.A solid price increase over a period of 12 weeks reflects investors' continued willingness to pay more for the potential upside in a stock. VLO is quite a good fit in this regard, gaining 47.7% over this period.However, it's not enough to look at the price change for around three months, as it doesn't reflect any trend reversal that might have happened in a shorter time frame. It's important for a potential winner to maintain the price trend. A price increase of 4.8% over the past four weeks ensures that the trend is still in place for the stock of this oil refiner.Moreover, VLO is currently trading at 98.8% of its 52-week High-Low Range, hinting that it can be on the verge of a breakout.Looking at the fundamentals, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top 5% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises -- the key factors that impact a stock's near-term price movements.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>Another factor that confirms the company's fundamental strength is its Average Broker Recommendation of #1 (Strong Buy). This indicates that the brokerage community is highly optimistic about the stock's near-term price performance.So, the price trend in VLO may not reverse anytime soon.In addition to VLO, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our ""Recent Price Strength"" screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past. You could easily do that with the help of the Zacks Research Wizard.

Due to the continued impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and operating limitations, Equinor revised the expected commencement date several times to allow additional time to prepare for safe start-up and operations.The first LNG is on tank at the liquefaction facility, situated on Melkoya Island in Norway. Per Equinor, the facility will recommence shipments in the next few days. Notably, the company’s Hammerfest facility has a processing capacity of more than four million tons of gas per year.Hammerfest is the only large-scale LNG facility in Europe. The LNG volumes from the facility are responsible for 5% of Norway’s gas exports. The facility receives and processes natural gas from the Snohvit field in the Barents Sea. The gas is transferred in a 160-kilometer pipeline, which transports the field’s well stream to the Hammerfest LNG facility.During regular production, the Hammerfest facility delivers 6.5 billion cubic meters per year. This is equivalent to the annual gas requirements of 6.5 million European households. The resumption of production would address the plight of Europe’s strained LNG market, which has been seeking alternatives to Russian supplies due to the country’s aggressive invasion of Ukraine.Headquartered in Stavanger, Norway, Equinor is one of the leading integrated energy companies in the world.Shares of EQNR have outperformed the industry in the past six months. The stock has gained 45.7% compared with the industry’s 42.2% growth. Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEquinor currently sports a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Investors interested in the energy sector might look at the following companies that also presently flaunt a Zacks Rank #1.

Amid all of the volatility and the economic unknowns, investors might want to consider buying strong dividend-paying stocks for the summer and beyond.The stock market ripped higher on Thursday, resuming its recent momentum that began after the S&P 500 came within inches of a bear market on May 20. Last week, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq posted big gains to end seven-week skids. In fact, all three major U.S. indexes jumped 6% or higher for the first time since November 2020.Many of the same economic and market headwinds remain firmly in place, namely rising prices and the Fed’s rate hike push. The Russian invasion continues to hit the oil and energy market, and there are only now signs of some key Chinese cities returning to normal life following months of strict, zero-covid lockdowns.The market appears to be cheering the fact that the Fed hasn’t yet said it will ramp up its tightening efforts beyond its current roadmap. Plus, Wall Street is perhaps starting to realize the central bank isn’t on autopilot and it will update its rate-hike efforts accordingly.Despite strong consumer spending and soaring prices, there are signs that inflation might be starting to come down, or might have at least peaked. And investors continue to pour money into U.S. stocks during the downturn because they are bullish on the long-term outlook for the economy and the market. A lack of suitable alternatives to keep pace with 8% inflation is also fueling retail investors to buy stocks.Of course, this doesn’t mean it’s time to just start racing back into growth-focused technology stocks, and calling a bottom is extremely difficult in real time. Instead, it might be best to search for stocks that pay a dividend and are poised to expand both their top and bottom lines during the current market turbulence.The first stock up is Valero Energy Corporation VLO. Valero’s core business remains refining and processing crude to turn it into products such as gasoline and other petrochemical offshoots. VLO is also expanding its renewable-focused efforts and its dividend and outlook remain impressive.Next up is self-storage standout Life Storage, Inc. LSI. Life Storage has been gaining momentum for decades as Americans continue to buy more and more things, from furniture to electronics. Life Storage’s valuation, outlook, and dividend payout are looking as strong as ever.U.S. oil and gas powerhouse Chevron Corporation CVX is the final stock on the list today.

Shares have added about 6.2% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Delek US Holdings due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Delek US Holdings reported first-quarter 2022 adjusted profit of 58 cents a share, handsomely beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 14 cents. This outperformance could be attributed to the refining landscape having improved substantially from the pandemic-driven downturn over the past couple of years, prompted by a recent surge in energy prices. Moreover, the bottom line was substantially better than the year-ago quarter’s loss of $1.69 per share, attributable to stronger-than-expected contributions from its refining segment. The margin from the refining unit was $96.9 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $76 million.Quarterly revenues of $4.5 billion compared favorably with the year-ago sales of $2.4 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.8 billion.Refining:  DK reported a positive margin of $96.9 million for this segment compared with $10.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, the adjusted margin of $152.9 million rebounded from a negative $3.9 million in the year-ago period. On a year-over-year basis, results in this segment were favorably impacted by increased demand, attributable in part to low clean product inventories and continued macroeconomic improvements amid the pandemic, combined with the impact of sanctions on the Russian oil supply and corresponding improvements in crack spreads.Logistics:  This unit represents Delek’s majority interest in Delek Logistics Partners, L.P., a publicly traded master limited partnership that owns, operates, develops and acquires pipelines and other midstream assets. The Logistics unit’s margin of $62.3 million was higher than the year-ago period’s figure of $56.9 million. This improvement was led by an increase in the utilization of assets supporting the Big Spring Refinery and enhanced throughput in joint venture pipelines.Retail: The margin for the unit, which was formed by the acquisition of Alon USA Energy in 2017, declined by about 17.4% to $13.8 million from the year-earlier quarter’s level of $16.7 million. Delek’s merchandise sales of $69.7 million, with a margin of 34.6%, on average, compared unfavorably with $74.6 million sales, carrying a margin of 32.7%, on average, in the prior year. Its retail fuel gallon sales totaled 39.5 million in the reported quarter, the average margin being 31 cents per gallon. This compared marginally unfavorably with 39.8 million sales, the average margin being 35 cents per gallon in the first quarter of 2021.Total operating expenses incurred in the quarter increased by about 80.9% from the prior-year period’s level to $4,412.4 million.In the reported quarter, Delek spent $32.9 million on capital programs (about 43.5% on the Refining segment). As of Mar 31, 2022, DK had cash and cash equivalents worth $854.1 million and long-term debt of $2,130.7 million, with debt to total capital of about 69.4%.Delek projects the second-quarter 2022 crude oil throughput to average between 280,000 and 290,000 barrels per day or roughly 94% utilization at the midpoint.For full-year 2022, Delek maintains the capital expense guidance of around the $250-$260 million range, excluding capital spending associated with the planned 3Bear acquisition that is expected to close around mid-year.The company mentioned that it is looking at a dividend payout and a share buyback in the second quarter or the third quarter after second-quarter results are declared.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates revision.The consensus estimate has shifted 107.16% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Delek US Holdings has a nice Growth Score of B, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with an A. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise Delek US Holdings has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerDelek US Holdings belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry. Another stock from the same industry, Valero Energy (VLO), has gained 3.4% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended March 2022.Valero Energy reported revenues of $38.54 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +85.2%.

Institutions will often hold stock in bigger companies, and we expect to see insiders owning a noticeable percentage of the smaller ones. Companies that have been privatized tend to have low insider ownership.Phillips 66 has a market capitalization of US$50b, so it's too big to fly under the radar. We'd expect to see both institutions and retail investors owning a portion of the company. Taking a look at our data on the ownership groups (below), it seems that institutions are noticeable on the share registry. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Phillips 66. Check out our latest analysis for Phillips 66 Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Phillips 66 does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Phillips 66's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Phillips 66. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.5%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.3% and 6.6% of the stock.A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Phillips 66. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$100m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 28% stake in Phillips 66. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should learn about the   4 warning signs  we've spotted with Phillips 66 (including 1 which is a bit unpleasant) .If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

Shares have added about 7.9% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Marathon Petroleum due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Independent oil refiner and marketer Marathon Petroleum reported earnings per share of $1.49, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.12 and compared with a loss of 37 cents per share in the year-ago period. The company’s bottom line was favorably impacted by the stronger-than-expected performance of both segments. Precisely, operating income from the Refining & Marketing and the Midstream units totaled $768 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, ahead of their Zacks Consensus Estimates by 43.2% and 1.6%.Marathon Petroleum reported revenues of $38.4 billion that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $27.9 billion and improved 67.7% year over year. The company repurchased shares worth $2.5 billion during the February-April period and has now completed around 80% of its target to buy back $10 billion in common stock. This was after Marathon Petroleum concluded the sale of its Speedway business, comprising approximately 3,900 c-stores in 35 states to Japan-based retail group Seven &i Holdings — the owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain — for $21 billion.Refining & Marketing: The Refining & Marketing segment reported operating income of $768 million, turning around from the year-ago loss of $598 million. The improvement primarily reflects higher year-over-year margins and throughputs.Specifically, refining margin of $15.31 per barrel improved significantly from $10.16 a year ago. Total refined product sales volumes were 3,293 thousand barrels per day (mbpd), up from the 3,067 mbpd in the year-ago quarter. Throughput rose from 2,565 mbpd in the year-ago quarter to 2,833 mbpd but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2,846 mbpd. Capacity utilization during the quarter was up from last year’s 83% to 91%.Midstream: This unit mainly reflects Marathon Petroleum’s general partner and majority limited partner interests in MPLX LP — a publicly traded master limited partnerships that own, operate, develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets.Segment profitability was $1.1 billion, 10.3% higher than the first quarter of 2021. Earnings were supported by stable, fee-based revenues from MPLX’s wide range of midstream energy services.Marathon Petroleum reported expenses of $36.7 billion in first-quarter 2022, rising 61.8% from the year-ago quarter.In the reported quarter, Marathon Petroleum spent $573 million on capital programs (43% on Refining & Marketing and 49% on the Midstream segment) compared to $410 million in the year-ago period. As of Mar 31, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $7.1 billion and total debt, including that of MPLX, of $26.7 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 46.8%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates revision.The consensus estimate has shifted 44.65% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Marathon Petroleum has a great Growth Score of A, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise Marathon Petroleum has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerMarathon Petroleum is part of the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry. Over the past month, Phillips 66 (PSX), a stock from the same industry, has gained 7.3%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended March 2022 more than a month ago.Phillips 66 reported revenues of $36.72 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +67.5%. EPS of $1.32 for the same period compares with -$1.16 a year ago.Phillips 66 is expected to post earnings of $3.56 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +381.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +10.9%.The overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Phillips 66.

Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.The fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Phillips 66 (PSX) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to PSX for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Phillips 66's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Phillips 66's main business drivers.Based in Houston, TX, Phillips 66's operations incorporate refining, midstream, marketing and specialties, and chemicals. The company, in its current form, came into existence following the 2012 spin-off of ConocoPhillips' downstream business into a separate, independent and publicly-traded entity. The company’s operations include processing, transportation, storing and marketing fuels and products all over the world. Phillips 66 Partners, the company's master limited partnership, is an important asset in the portfolio. The company operates through the four business segments, namely, Midstream, Chemicals, Refining, and Marketing and Specialties.Midstream – contributed $1,902 million to total earnings in 2021 – gathers, processes, transports and markets natural gas; and transports, fractionates and markets NGL in the United States. In addition, this segment transports crude oil and other feedstocks to its refineries and other locations, and delivers refined and specialty products to the market.Chemicals – contributed $1899 million in profits – manufacture and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. The segment consists of its 50% stake in the joint venture (JV) with Chevron, named Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC.Assets of the JV are primarily located on the U.S. Texas Gulf Coast and Middle East. Moreover, the JV has manufacturing properties all around the world.Refining – delivered $1,144 million loss – buys, sells and refines crude oil and other feedstocks at its refineries. The company owns interest in 13 refineries located in the United States and in Europe.Marketing and Specialties – contributed $1,815 million in profits – purchases for resale and markets refined products, mainly in the United States and Europe. In addition, this segment includes the manufacturing and marketing of specialty products.Phillips 66 recently completed the acquisition of Phillips 66 Partners’ remaining units for $3.4 billion. The acquisition is expected to simplify Phillips 66’s governance and corporate structure.Bottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Phillips 66 ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in June 2012 would be worth $3,448.53, or a 244.85% gain, as of June 2, 2022, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.In comparison, the S&P 500 gained 220.90% and the price of gold went up 9.35% over the same time frame.Analysts are anticipating more upside for PSX.Phillips 66is the leading player in each of its operations like refining, chemicals and midstream in terms of size, efficiency and strength. With its pipeline network spreading across 22,000 miles, the company is a leader in the midstream business, generating stable fee-based revenues. The company is well-poised to make huge profit from higher demand for distillate fuel. Phillips 66 recently reported strong first-quarter results, owing to stronger refining margins. However, the company’s significant exposure to debt is concerning. It expects jet fuel and overall refined products’ demand to stay down. Hence, the company will miss the potential gain in refining margins. Also, it has been constantly bearing the brunt of increasing costs over the past few quarters, adversely affecting the income. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.The stock has jumped 7.29% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 4 higher, for fiscal 2022; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This, in turn, further strengthens ReneSola’s presence in the United States and enables the company to capitalize on the growing solar market of the two regions to curtail climate crisis effects.On Jun 2, 2022, SOL’s 22-megawatt (MW) Roosevelt solar project in Massena, NY was picked by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority as part of its endeavor to achieve 70% renewable-based energy by 2030 and zero emissions by 2040. Also, this project is one of the 22 projects that New York seeks to add to achieve its ambitious renewable target.Meanwhile, on May 12, 2022, ReneSola’s 20 MW utility-scale solar project in Wilmington, IL was awarded a 20-year Index REC contract as Illinois aims to double its investment in renewable energy to reach 40% renewable-based energy by 2030 and 50% by 2040.Such contract wins are likely to enhance ReneSola’s footprint in the U.S. solar market and assist the company in duly meeting its 3 gigawatts (GW) of a mid-to-late-stage pipeline target by end of 2022 and 5 GW by 2024.Solar capacity additions in the United States are likely to go up by leaps and bounds due to the Biden-led government’s increased focus on making the environment carbon free and reducing dependence on fossil fuels. In this context, per the latest short-term energy outlook report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, solar capacity additions to the electric power sector will be 20 GW for 2022 and 22 GW for 2023, while the small-scale solar capacity is expected to grow to 39 GW by the end of 2022 and 46 GW in 2023.Against this backdrop, we may safely conclude that the underlying strength in the U.S. solar market is likely to benefit major solar companies operating in the region. To this end, SOL and other solar companies that can enjoy the perks of the expanding U.S. solar market are:Enphase Energy ENPH: It enjoys a strong position in the global solar space as a leading U.S. manufacturer of microinverters and fully integrated solar-plus-storage solutions. In the fourth quarter of 2021, Enphase Energy introduced its IQ8 family of microinverters to residential installers in North America and expects to introduce the same internationally in the second half of 2022.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Enphase Energy’s 2022 sales implies a growth rate of 49.9% from the prior-year reported figure. ENPH shares have returned 22.8% in the past year.Canadian SolarCSIQ: It has a strong pipeline of projects and carries out various acquisitions and strategies to further consolidate its position. In May 2022, Canadian Solar completed the construction of a 100 MW renewable solar power plant near Ruleville in the Mississippi Delta. The Sunflower Solar Station is the largest solar installation in Mississippi and provides enough energy to power 16,000 homes.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Canadian Solar’s 2022 sales indicates an improvement of 41.2% from the prior-year reported figure. CSIQ shares have returned 25.8% in the past month.First Solar FSLR currently operates many of the world’s largest grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) power plants. In May 2022, First Solar signed an agreement with Scout Clean Energy, a renewable energy developer and owner-operator headquartered in Boulder, CO, to supply 378 MW DC of advanced, responsibly produced thin-film PV solar modules.First Solar’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 13.2%. Shares of FSLR have rallied 0.6% in the past month.In the past month, shares of ReneSola have rallied 10.1% compared with the industry’s rise of 27.6%.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchReneSola currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Here’s what you need to know.","While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. We'll use ROE to examine Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH), by way of a worked example.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Enphase Energy The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Enphase Energy is:50% = US$166m ÷ US$331m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.50 in profit.Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Enphase Energy has a better ROE than the average (19%) in the Semiconductor industry.That's what we like to see. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for Enphase Energy.Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.We think Enphase Energy uses a significant amount of debt to maximize its returns, as it has a significantly higher debt to equity ratio of 3.88. So although the company has an impressive ROE, the company might not have been able to achieve this without the significant use of debt.Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.But note: Enphase Energy may not be the best stock to buy.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Enphase Energy ENPH, SunPower SPWR and First Solar FSLR.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Dell Technologies is a provider of information technology solutions. The company's operating segments include Client Solutions, Enterprise Solutions Group, and Dell Software Group.The company's Client Solutions segment includes sales to commercial and consumer customers of desktops, thin client products, notebooks, and third-party software and peripherals of Client Solutions Hardware.Dell's Enterprise Solutions Group includes servers, networking, storage, services, third-party software, and peripherals of ESG hardware.The Dell Software Group segment includes systems management, security software solutions, and information management software offerings.Shares have held up relatively well year-to-date, declining approximately 15% and outperforming the general market by a small margin.Over the last year, the picture remains the same – DELL shares have marginally outperformed the S&P 500.The company's share performance is inspiring – many companies have witnessed deep double-digit valuation slashes throughout 2022. Additionally, the share performance tells us that shares have provided investors with a valuable blend of defense.Dell has consistently reported strong quarterly results, exceeding bottom-line estimates in eight of its last ten quarters. Over the last four quarters, the information technology solutions provider has beat on the bottom line by 8% on average, and in its latest quarterly report, DELL crushed bottom-line estimates by a sizable 33%.The company sports an enticingly low 8.2X forward earnings multiple, nowhere near 2018 highs of 17.5X and nicely below the five-year median of 10.0X. Furthermore, the value represents a deep 53% discount relative to the S&P 500's forward P/E ratio of 17.4X.DELL sports a Style Score of an A for Value.Analysts have been positively revising their quarterly estimates over the last 60 days, undoubtedly a major positive and a reason the company sports the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). For the current fiscal year, the Consensus Estimate Trend has increased by a notable 6%, reflecting full-year earnings of $7.04 per share – a sizable 14% year-over-year increase.Additionally, looking forward, the $7.62 EPS estimate for the next fiscal year has DELL increasing its earnings by a respectable 8.2% year-over-year.Looking at sales, the $107 billion revenue estimate for FY23 displays a marginal 0.3% expansion in the top line, and in FY24, the $108 billion estimate reflects an additional 1.5% growth in revenue.Dell Technologies rewards its shareholders via its 2.7% annual dividend yield with a sustainable payout ratio of 17% of earnings. The annual yield is much higher than the S&P 500's yield of 1.5%, and the company has increased its dividend once over the past five years.Dividends are a significant boost to any portfolio, providing a stream of income that can alleviate drawdowns within a portfolio.One of the best ways investors can find expected winners within the market is by utilizing the Zacks Rank – one of the most potent market tools out there. A portfolio consisting of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of 25%.Additionally, the top 5% of all stocks receive the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These stocks should outperform the market more than any other rank.Dell Technologies would be an excellent bet for investors looking to add a solid stock to their portfolios, as displayed by its Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).American Eagle Outfitters Inc. is a specialty retailer of casual apparel, accessories, outerwear, and footwear for men and women. It, along with its subsidiaries, engages in the designing and marketing of casual clothing.Year-to-date, AEO shares have pulled back significantly, declining by a jaw-dropping 52% and coming nowhere close to the S&P 500's performance.Stretching out the time frame to over the past year, the story remains the same – AEO shares have been stuck in a deep downtrend throughout the period, losing nearly 65% of their value and underperforming the S&P 500 extensively.This clothing retailer's poor share performance is just the first red flag.AEO has struggled to chain together EPS beats as of late, missing bottom line estimates by a very concerning 33% in its latest quarter. Additionally, quarterly revenue results leave something to be desired – AEO has beaten top line estimates just five times out of its ten last quarters, undoubtedly a sign that the company has struggled.Analysts have been negatively revising their earnings estimates across the board over the last 60 days, with nearly a 100% agreement revision percentage across all time frames.For the upcoming quarter, the Consensus Estimate Trend has fallen by a double-digit 58%, reflecting EPS of $0.17 and a nasty 71% decline in earnings from the year-ago quarter.Current fiscal year estimates also raise a red flag; the $1.32 EPS estimate displays a sizable 40% decrease in earnings year-over-year.AEO shares have been the victim of a deep double-digit valuation slash over the last year. This, paired with negative estimate revisions and weak revenue results, undoubtedly paints a grim picture for the company within the short term.The company is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and a stock that investors will be better off staying away from for now. Instead, investors should pivot to stocks that either carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) – the odds of reaping considerable gains are much higher within the companies that carry these ranks.U.S. solar stocks are likely to shine brightly in the days ahead, following the recent actions taken by the Biden administration in favor of the solar industry. In particular, the White House has decided to waive off any potential new tariffs on solar panels from four Southeast Asian nations for two years to boost solar installation at an affordable price.Further, to accelerate the domestic production of clean energy technologies, including solar panel parts, Biden recently invoked the Defense Production Act (""DPA"").Such strategies bode well for the U.S. solar industry's growth trajectory. This puts the spotlight on major industry participants like Enphase Energy, SunPower and First Solar, which are well-poised to rejuvenate amid the current reforms.The recent authorization by the U.S. President to use DPA will enable the Department of Energy to rapidly expand the American manufacturing of five critical clean energy technologies, mainly solar panel parts, building insulation, heat pumps, equipment like fuel cells and electrolyzers and power grid infrastructure.Moreover, as the DPA declaration empowers the government to induce funds for the domestic production of solar components, it will reduce the dependence of the nation on the imports of solar components and parts. This, in turn, will further ease supply-chain susceptibility and boost the top-line growth of U.S.-based solar panel manufacturers.Further, considering that the U.S. solar industry relies heavily on Southeast Asian countries for the supply of solar modules, by waiving off potential tariffs on solar components, Biden aims to lower the cost of components and ease the supply of solar components at present.Of late, the U.S. solar industry has been encountering pandemic-induced supply-chain vulnerabilities and a high cost of components amid soaring inflation. Against this backdrop, actions taken by the Biden-led government would help America duly achieve its target of tripling the domestic solar manufacturing capacity by 2024. In light of the aforementioned factors, U.S.-based solar stocks that investors should keep in their watchlist are:Enphase Energy: Enphase enjoys a strong position as a leading U.S. manufacturer of microinverters and has a valuable position in manufacturing fully integrated solar-plus-storage solutions.In the first quarter of 2022, Enphase's revenues from the United States improved a solid 49% on a year-over-year basis. To further expand its market in America's solar industry, ENPH acquired SolarLeadFactory, which provides high-quality leads for solar installers in the United States, in March 2022.SunPower: SunPower designs, develops, manufactures, markets and sells high-performance solar electric power technology products, systems and services worldwide for residential, commercial and utility-scale power plant customers.SunPower added 16,500 customers in the first quarter of 2022, reflecting growth of 40% year over year. SPWR expects its residential customer volume to grow by more than 35% in 2022 over 2021.First Solar: First Solar is a leading global provider of comprehensive PV solar energy solutions and specializes in designing, manufacturing and selling solar electric power modules.In 2021, First Solar announced plans to expand its manufacturing capacity by 6.6 Gigawatt (GW) by constructing its third manufacturing facility in the United States and first manufacturing facility in India. Such capacity expansion will enable FSLR to maintain its position as the largest U.S. solar module manufacturer.Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

(NASDAQ: ENPH), a global energy technology company and the world's leading supplier of microinverter-based solar and battery systems, announced today that installers of Enphase® products in Florida have seen growing deployments of Enphase Energy Systems powered by IQ® Microinverters and IQ™ Batteries, as Florida homeowners prepare for power outages this hurricane season.Residential battery capacity in Florida is increasing steadily year-over-year with forecasts estimating deployments will grow nearly seven-fold by the end of 2026, according to the most recent U.S. Energy Storage Monitor report from the Energy Storage Association and Wood Mackenzie.“Florida homeowners understand all too well the threat severe weather like hurricanes pose to the electric grid and the immeasurable value of a resilient home battery storage system,” said Raul Vergara, owner at Cutler Bay Solar, an Enphase Platinum level installer. “IQ8 Microinverters and IQ Batteries enable our customers to build a system that meets their unique household needs and provide reliable backup power to their homes when they need it most.”Homeowners in Florida can now also choose to install Enphase’s revolutionary IQ8™ Microinverters. IQ8-based systems can provide Sunlight Backup™ during an outage, even without a battery. For homeowners who want battery backup, there are no sizing restrictions on pairing an Enphase IQ Battery with IQ8 Microinverters. In addition, with the Sunlight Jump Start™ feature, IQ8 Microinverters can restart a home energy system using sunlight only after prolonged grid outages that may result in a fully depleted battery. This eliminates the need for a manual restart of the system and gives homeowners even greater resilience.“Several years ago, Hurricane Irma triggered one of the nation’s largest natural disaster-related power outages ever measured, leaving nearly 5 million households without power,” said Billy May, owner at May Electric Solar, an Enphase Platinum level installer. “Since then, customer demand for reliable backup power has grown. Enphase solar and battery products offer a resilient solution to meet just about every homeowner need. The seamless power transfer with no fuel costs to operate are just a few on many benefits of an Enphase solar and battery system.”“Having solar panels in the Sunshine State is a no-brainer to save money and reduce a household’s reliance on traditional grid power,” said Brian Miller, owner at PES Solar, an Enphase Platinum level installer. “Floridians who add Enphase IQ8 Microinverters and IQ Batteries to their residential energy systems can also reap the benefits of being able to continue to generate, store, and use energy when they need it, even when the grid is down.”“We’re seeing increased demand in Enphase Energy Systems from homeowners looking to secure their power supply and maximize the benefits of clean solar energy,” said Brandon Bing, owner at All American Solar, an Enphase Platinum level installer. “We’re proud to offer our residential customers the comfort of knowing the Enphase system will keep the lights on whether the grid is available or not.”Enphase delivers a safer solar-plus-battery solution that does not expose installers or homeowners to high-voltage direct current (DC). Enphase IQ Batteries feature Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) battery chemistry, which provides a long cycle life and safer operation through excellent thermal stability. The batteries are equipped with Enphase Power Start™ technology, which helps seamlessly power-up air conditioners and well-pumps. The Enphase IQ Batteries accommodate over-the-air software upgrades and come with a 10-year limited warranty, while Enphase IQ8 solar microinverters come with a 25-year limited warranty.“Enphase is pleased to work with Florida installers to provide homeowners with industry-leading and comprehensive home energy solutions to help power their essentials during outages and stay safe from natural disasters,” said Dave Ranhoff, chief commercial officer at Enphase Energy. “High-quality products and a focus on customer service make Enphase Energy Systems a smart choice for homeowners looking to take control of their energy future.”For more information about Enphase IQ Batteries and IQ8 Microinverters, please visit the Enphase website.About Enphase Energy, Inc.Enphase Energy, a global energy technology company based in Fremont, CA, is the world's leading supplier of microinverter-based solar and battery systems that enable people to harness the sun to make, use, save, and sell their own power—and control it all with a smart mobile app. The company revolutionized the solar industry with its microinverter-based technology and builds all-in-one solar, battery, and software solutions.

It remains committed to its gasification strategy and is executing its growth projects. These projects are expected to be accretive to earnings and cash flows. The company has a total available capacity to deploy (over fiscal 2018-2027) around $34.2 billion in high-return investments aimed at creating significant shareholder value. It has already spent or committed roughly 74% of the capacity.The company, in October 2021, completed the asset acquisition and project financing transactions of the $12-billion Jazan project in in Saudi Arabia. It expects to close the Phase Two of this project in 2023.Last year, it also announced the $4.5 billion world-class clean energy complex in Louisiana. The project, the company’s largest-ever investment, is expected to produce more than 750 million standard cubic feet per day of blue hydrogen for local and global markets by 2026.Air Products, in April 2020, also completed the buyout of five steam methane reformer hydrogen production plants for $530 million from PBF Energy.

It is witnessing higher power costs in its merchant business. The company is seeing significantly higher energy costs, especially in EMEA due to the considerably high natural gas and electricity costs.

Hydrogen volumes fell on a sequential comparison basis in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 due to outages. The company expects high levels of planned outages in the fiscal third quarter.

The analysts have sharply increased their revenue numbers, with a view that Albemarle will make substantially more sales than they'd previously expected.Following the upgrade, the most recent consensus for Albemarle from its 18 analysts is for revenues of US$6.1b in 2022 which, if met, would be a huge 67% increase on its sales over the past 12 months. Prior to the latest estimates, the analysts were forecasting revenues of US$5.4b in 2022. It looks like there's been a clear increase in optimism around Albemarle, given the substantial gain in revenue forecasts. See our latest analysis for Albemarle We'd point out that there was no major changes to their price target of US$283, suggesting the latest estimates were not enough to shift their view on the value of the business. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Albemarle at US$368 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$135. Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business.One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. The analysts are definitely expecting Albemarle's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 98% annualised growth to the end of 2022 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 2.8% per annum over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 3.4% annually. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that Albemarle is expected to grow much faster than its industry.The highlight for us was that analysts increased their revenue forecasts for Albemarle this year. They're also forecasting more rapid revenue growth than the wider market. Given that analysts appear to be expecting substantial improvement in the sales pipeline, now could be the right time to take another look at Albemarle.Using these estimates as a starting point, we've run a discounted cash flow calculation (DCF) on Albemarle that suggests the company could be somewhat undervalued.

ADI as the Bull of the Day and Urban Outfitters, Inc. URBN  asthe Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Diamondback Energy, Inc. FANG, Pioneer Natural Resources Company PXD, and Matador Resources Company's MTDR.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Analog Devices, Inc. is a leader in the analog semiconductor space that's aiming to compete against Texas Instruments for supremacy.Analog Devices topped our second quarter fiscal 2022 financial results on May 18 and provided upbeat guidance in the face of ongoing supply chain bottlenecks and a slowing economy. ADI continues to benefit from larger secular changes in the economy such as electrification.Semiconductor maker Analog Devices expanded its reach to help it challenge the biggest player in the analog space, Texas Instruments, when it completed its acquisition of Maxim Integrated in August 2021. Analog semiconductors are on the less flashy side of the booming chip industry that will remain the backbone of technology and arguably the entire economy for the foreseeable future. Analog semiconductors play crucial roles in countless devices and industries that next-generation digital semiconductors cannot meet. Analog chips help handle information not easily understood with 1s and 0s, such as temperature, speed, sound, electrical currents, and much more.Analog Devices and its beefed-up portfolio includes analog and mixed-signal, power management, as well as radio frequency, and digital and sensor technologies. ADI boasts around 125K customers globally for its over 75K products.Roughly half of Analog Devices' 2021 revenue came from clients in the industrial sector, with 20% in automotive, 15% in communications, and 16% in the consumer markets. Analog Devices executives expect to benefit over the long haul from the constant expansion of automation, electrification (such as electric vehicles and beyond), and advanced connectivity.More specifically, ADI projects to grow within six broad areas: Industrial 4.0, automotive ecosystems, connectivity & data centers, digital healthcare, immersive consumer, and aerospace.Analog Devices' revenue and adjusted earnings both climbed by roughly 31% in fiscal 2021, driven in part by its Maxim Integrated deal. Analog Devices beat our Q1 FY22 estimates in mid-February and raised its outlook. ADI then on May 18 topped our Q2 estimates and offered up guidance that came in well above Wall Street projections once again, even as countless companies across an array of industries lower their outlooks.The company's FY22 consensus earnings estimate is up 11% from where it was, with FY23's outlook over 12% higher. This bottom-line positivity helps Analog Devices land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now.Current Zacks estimates call for ADI's revenue to climb another 62% this year to $11.8 billion and around 7% higher in FY23. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to surge 43% and 9%, respectively. The slowing growth in 2023 reflects smoothed-out YoY comparison following its Maxim Integrated acquisition.Analog Devices stock has climbed 127% in the last five years to outpace the broader Zacks Tech sector's 90% and its Semi-Analog & Mixed Market's 111%. ADI shares have also fared far better recently than its tech peers, with the stock up 3% in the past 12 months compared to Tech's 16% fall and the S&P 500's 1% decline.The stock hasn't been immune to the 2022 downturn, but it's only fallen 5%, while the market is down 14%. At around $165 per share, ADI trades 12% below its November records. This also provides the stock 25% upside to its Zacks consensus price target.The downturn and its strong earnings outlook has Analog Devices trading right near its covid lows at 17.3X forward 12-month earnings. This also marks a discount to its industry and 10% value compared to its own five-year median. And ADI's Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry is in the top 8% of over 250 Zacks industries right now.Alongside its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which is driven by its double-digit, post-earnings release EPS revisions, Wall Street is bullish on Analog Devices, with 75% of the brokerage recommendations Zacks has at either ""Strong Buy"" or ""Buys,"" with nothing below a ""Hold."" Investors also get a nice bonus of a dividend from a growth-focused technology stock.Analog Devices in February raised its dividend by 10%, which was its 19th raise in the last 18 years. ADI's dividend yields 1.8% right now to top many of its peers and the S&P 500's 1.4%.Urban Outfitters, Inc. stock has plummeted over 40% in the last year, alongside its industry's 53% downturn.The youth-focused apparel retailer fell short of Zacks earnings and revenue estimates on May 24. Urban Outfitters is one of the many victims of soaring prices and supply chain setbacks that have made running its fast-fashion operation extremely difficult.Urban Outfitters is a clothing and apparel retailer that's expanded its reach into other areas. URBN operates a sizable brand portfolio that includes Anthropologie, Free People, its namesake segment, and more. Urban also owns a portfolio of wedding related-offerings, as well as what it calls a menus and venues segment.Urban Outfitters and many of its established brick and mortar-focused peers in apparel retail have struggled to keep up with the quickly changing world of e-commerce and social-media retail. Urban has more competition than ever before from an array of upstarts and niche brands that thrive by marketing to URBN's core youth demographic.Urban Outfitters stock is down 20% in the last 10 years, compared to the S&P 500's over 300% climb. URBN has gone on some wild up and down runs during this stretch. And potential investors should know that Urban Outfitters stock is pretty heavily shorted at the moment. This helps make URBN more of a trader's stock than a buy-and-hold investment.Urban Outfitters posted somewhat solid first quarter results on May 24. But the company's second quarter consensus earnings estimate has tumbled from $1.00 to $0.73 per share since its report, with its current full-year figure down by roughly 18% and next year about 15% off the pace. ""The impact of inflation on our costs of doing business more than offset the benefit of record revenues,"" CEO Richard Hayne said in prepared Q1 remarks.Urban Outfitters' downward EPS revisions help it grab a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) right now. Plus, its Retail - Apparel and Shoes space sits in the bottom 12% of over 250 Zacks industries. URBN stock did pop on Wednesday. But it still might be best for investors to stay away from the retailer given its own issues and the negative forces dragging down its industry.So far this year, West Texas Intermediate oil price has improved more than 54%. Exploration and production businesses are thus witnessing significant gains on the back of a healthy crude price trajectory, with the energy sector already sprung back to life.West Texas Intermediate crude price, trading at more than $115 per barrel, has risen drastically in the past year. The significant rise in oil prices can be attributed to analysts' assumptions that the Ukraine war may be prolonged.The recent surge in the commodity price is backed by the news that an accord has recently been reached by the European Union (EU) leaders to ban 90% of Russian crude. Thus, the EU will impose its harshest sanctions yet on Russia.In June, total oil production from shale resources in the United States will likely increase by 142,000 barrels per day to 8,761 thousand barrels per day (MBbl/D), per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). The shale resources comprise Anadarko, Appalachia, Bakken, Eagle Ford, Haynesville, Niobrara and Permian.Of all the resources, Permian will witness the highest increase in daily oil production this month, according to the EIA's drilling productivity report. In the Permian, the EIA projects oil production to rise by 88,000 barrels per day to 5,219 MBbls/D in June.It has been crystal clear that a favorable crude pricing scenario is backing higher production volumes. Improving Permian production amid healthy oil prices has raised the incentive to add stocks of companies operating in the most prolific basin.Since selecting the right companies with a footprint in the Permian from the stock universe is not an easy task, we are employing our proprietary Stock Screener to zero down on three prospective stocks. One of the stocks sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while two carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Diamondback Energy, Inc. is a leading pure-play Permian operator, having a solid footprint in 423,000 net acres in the prolific Midland and Delaware sub-basins. Zacks #2 Ranked Diamondback Energy is guiding its oil production for 2022 almost flat compared with 2021 and is expecting its free cash flow to increase more than 49% this year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Diamondback Energy's earnings per share for 2022 and 2023 has been revised upward in the past 30 days.Pioneer Natural Resources Company has a strong presence in the low-cost oil-rich Midland basin — a sub-basin of the broader Permian. The #2 Ranked upstream energy player has a massive inventory of premium wells that will likely generate significant returns for the company.Pioneer Natural is focused on returning capital to shareholders. This includes a substantial variable dividend along with a strong base dividend. PXD is also employing opportunistic share repurchases to reward shareholders.Pioneer Natural has considerably lower exposure to debt capital than the composite stocks belonging to the industry. This reflects PXD's strong balance sheet on which the firm can rely to sail through the volatile energy businesses.Improving oil prices is a boon for Matador Resources Company's upstream operations. This is because MTDR has a strong presence in oil-rich core acres of the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring plays in the Delaware Basin. Favorable oil price is likely to aid it in increasing production volumes. For 2022, the upstream energy player with a Zacks Rank of 1 expects total production at 37,300 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (MBoE), higher than 31,454 MBoE in 2021. In fact, since 2019, total production has been increasing persistently, contributing to the top and the bottom line.On another positive note, Matador plans to turn to sales a net of 69.7 wells this year, including operated and non-operated wells. Among the prime priorities that MTDR has set for this year are lowering debt levels, delivering free cashflows and maintaining or increasing dividends.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

A plethora of issues, including historically high inflation, stuttering economic growth, worries about a recession and a higher interest rate regime, tighter monetary policies adopted by major central banks, and prolonged supply-chain disruptions significantly hurt market participants’ confidence. However, a strong domestic demand picture and the labor market’s return to the pre-pandemic level helped the equities recover somewhat. At the end, May was evenly poised for investors, with the S&P 500 — regarded as one of the finest reflections of the stock market as a whole — little changed, losing 0.6% for the month.Although the S&P 500 finished the month essentially flat, a particular group of stocks stood out.On the sectoral front, it was Oil/Energy that topped the S&P standings for the month with a gain of 16%, while most others finished up marginally or lost value. The space has comprehensively outperformed the market, with the Energy Select Sector SPDR’s (an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies, popularly known by its ticker, XLE) impressive gains fueled by a constructive demand picture despite the geopolitical premium. To be precise, the energy index has continued to move higher this year after comfortably topping the S&P 500 leaderboard in 2021. It has generated a total return of more than 57% in 2022 compared with the S&P 500’s loss of 13.3%.The energy market continues to enjoy support from geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia’s military operations in Ukraine. In March, crude prices surged to multi-year highs of $130 on concerns about supplies from Russia, which is one of the world's largest producers of the commodity. The Biden administration’s ban on the import of Russian crude and energy products contributed to oil’s rapid price increase. Agreed, crude has pulled back from those lofty levels but with the conflict showing no signs of a quick resolution and the European Union finally following the United States in blocking imports of Russian energy — even at the detriment of their economies — is giving fresh impetus to the oil bulls.While there are jitters over soaring inflation and stuttering economic growth, these have been more than offset by the prospect of robust motor fuels’ consumption in the summer driving season that could see a release of built-up demand.Even the fundamentals point to a tightening of the market. Per the latest government report, U.S. commercial stockpiles have been down more than 13% in a year, prompted by a demand spike owing to the reopening of economies and a rebound in activity.Meanwhile, natural gas moved past $9 per million British thermal units (MMBtu). First, a late-season cold and then a quick turnaround to summer heat drove the fuel’s demand load. Natural gas also remained supported by a stable demand catalyst in the form of continued strong liquefied natural gas (LNG) feedgas deliveries. LNG shipments for export from the United States have been robust for months on the back of environmental reasons and record-high prices of the super-chilled fuel elsewhere. Now, with the Russia-Ukraine conflict, LNG has become even more coveted, with an increasing number of countries vying for the American-made fuel to replace supplies from Moscow. This means LNG deliveries are poised to rise further.While most energy investors have had something to cheer about in May, some stocks certainly performed better than the others. The five largest contributors to the monthly gains were Devon Energy DVN, Marathon Oil MRO, Occidental Petroleum OXY, Diamondback Energy FANG and Pioneer Natural Resources PXD.Will these winners maintain their run in June too, or will they eventually run out of steam? Here's a summary of them:Devon Energy: Devon is an independent energy company whose oil and gas operations are mainly concentrated in the onshore areas of North America, primarily in the United States. The company’s assets are spread across the key oil assets of Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Anadarko Basin and Powder River Basin.In the last reported quarter, Devon Energy reported adjusted earnings of $1.88, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.74 per share by 8.1%. The outperformance reflects the company’s oil-weighted production mix and low operating costs as well as recovery in commodity prices.This stock outperformed the other energy companies and was up 28.8% during the period, ranking second on the S&P 500 list. DVN’s merger with WPX Energy has strengthened its operations in the prolific Permian Basin. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) upstream operator’s cost management, divestiture of Canadian assets, and completion of the Barnett Shale gas assets sale will allow it to focus on its holdings in four high-quality, oil-rich U.S. basins. The company’s innovative dividend policy should also attract investors and position it for more upside in the near-to-medium term.Marathon Oil: The upstream energy company’s oil and gas operations are mainly concentrated in the United States (including Oklahoma, Eagle Ford, Bakken and Northern Delaware) and Equatorial Guinea.In the last reported quarter, Marathon reported adjusted earnings of $1.02, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.1%. MRO’s bottom line was favorably impacted by stronger liquid realizations and solid domestic production.Marathon, carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), rallied 26.1% in May and is poised for further capital appreciation. In particular, MRO’s robust operational metrics suggest strong long-term cash flows that should support higher price points for its shares. The wells drilled by Marathon have extremely low oil price breakeven costs and need oil prices of just $35 a barrel to be profitable. It’s also important to remember that the company’s significant debt maturities will mostly fall after 2025 and as such, there does not appear to be much risk here.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Occidental Petroleum: Founded in 1920, Houston, TX-based Occidental Petroleum is an integrated oil and gas company, with significant exploration and production exposure. OXY is also a producer of a variety of basic chemicals, petrochemicals, polymers and specialty chemicals.In the last reported quarter, OXY came up with earnings per share of $2.12, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97. The company’s bottom line was buoyed by strong operating efficiencies and higher commodity prices.This stock was the third-best sector performer on the S&P 500 Index, with shares appreciating 25.8% in the past month. It appears that Occidental will have more room to run up. It continues to increase production from high-quality asset holdings and lower outstanding debts through proceeds from non-core assets sale. The acquisition of Anadarko, investment to strengthen infrastructure and its Permian Basin exposure also continues to boost the performance of the Zacks Rank #1 company.Diamondback Energy: Diamondback Energy focuses on growth through a combination of acquisitions and active drilling in the Permian Basin. Diamondback's leading position in the unconventional play got another leg up with last year’s takeover of QEP Resources.Diamondback’s first-quarter bottom line came in above expectations, led by better-than-expected production and a surge in energy prices. FANG reported adjusted earnings of $5.20 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.74.This Zacks Rank #2 stock ended 22.7% higher in the last month. Diamondback appears well-positioned with its leading position in the Permian Basin, which was further strengthened by the acquisition of QEP Resources. The transaction has boosted FANG’s production and proved reserves in the region, and has offered synergy benefits. Diamondback also boasts a low-cost structure and investment-grade balance sheet, which should allow it to thrive in the ongoing commodity upcycle.Pioneer Natural Resources: It is an explorer and producer of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid. The leading upstream energy firm primarily has operations in the Permian, the most prolific basin in the United States.PXD’s first-quarter bottom line came in above expectations, reflecting higher oil-equivalent production volumes and commodity price realizations. Pioneer Natural reported earnings of $7.74 per share, which handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.32.This Zacks Rank #2 stock ended 22.5% higher in May. PXD appears well-positioned to benefit from the supportive industry fundamentals. One of the biggest producers in the Permian Basin, the company has a total holding in the basin of more than 1 million net acres, which supports long-term oil production growth. With its debt to capitalization being persistently lower than the industry over the past few years, Pioneer Natural is in good financial health.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Diamondback reported first-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $5.20, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.74, significantly more than the year-earlier period’s profit of $2.30.The outperformance can be attributed to the surge in energy prices in the first quarter, which lead to higher oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid sales. Diamondback’s average first-quarter output came in at 381,378 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), ahead of the consensus mark of 374,957 BOE/d.Revenues of $2.41 billion outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by approximately 25% and surged 103.4% from the year-ago quarter’s sales of $1.18 billion.In good news for investors, FANG raised its regular quarterly payout by almost 17% to 70 cents a share and also declared a variable dividend of $2.35, bringing the total distribution to $3.05.

While the crude output was up 21% year over year, natural gas volumes improved by about 25% year over year.The average realized oil price in the first quarter was $97.03 per barrel, 70.4% higher than the year-ago realization of $56.94 and also more than the consensus mark of $91. Meanwhile, the average realized natural gas price jumped to $3.61 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) from $3.05 in the year-ago period but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.02. Overall, the company fetched $69.60 per barrel compared with $42.36 a year ago.Diamondback’s first-quarter cash operating cost was $11.36 per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE), up 41% from the prior-year quarter.

The company forecast the capital spending budget between $1.75 billion and $1.9 billion. In the second quarter of 2022, the company expects capital spending between $435 and $475 million.As a consequence of the rise in commodity prices, FANG increased its expected cash tax rate to 10-15% of the pre-tax income from the previous 6-11%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates review have trended upward during the past month.VGM ScoresCurrently, Diamondback has a great Growth Score of A, a grade with the same score on the momentum front.

Exploration and production businesses are thus witnessing significant gains on the back of a healthy crude price trajectory, with the energy sector already sprung back to life.West Texas Intermediate crude price, trading at more than $115 per barrel, has risen drastically in the past year. The significant rise in oil prices can be attributed to analysts’ assumptions that the Ukraine war may be prolonged.The recent surge in the commodity price is backed by the news that an accord has recently been reached by the European Union (EU) leaders to ban 90% of Russian crude. Thus, the EU will impose its harshest sanctions yet on Russia.In June, total oil production from shale resources in the United States will likely increase by 142,000 barrels per day to 8,761 thousand barrels per day (MBbl/D), per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). The shale resources comprise Anadarko, Appalachia, Bakken, Eagle Ford, Haynesville, Niobrara and Permian.Of all the resources, Permian will witness the highest increase in daily oil production this month, according to the EIA’s drilling productivity report. In the Permian, the EIA projects oil production to rise by 88,000 barrels per day to 5,219 MBbls/D in June.It has been crystal clear that a favorable crude pricing scenario is backing higher production volumes. Improving Permian production amid healthy oil prices has raised the incentive to add stocks of companies operating in the most prolific basin.Since selecting the right companies with a footprint in the Permian from the stock universe is not an easy task, we are employing our proprietary Stock Screener to zero down on three prospective stocks. One of the stocks sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while two carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Diamondback Energy, Inc. FANG is a leading pure-play Permian operator, having a solid footprint in 423,000 net acres in the prolific Midland and Delaware sub-basins. Zacks #2 Ranked Diamondback Energy is guiding its oil production for 2022 almost flat compared with 2021 and is expecting its free cash flow to increase more than 49% this year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Diamondback Energy’s earnings per share for 2022 and 2023 has been revised upward in the past 30 days.Pioneer Natural Resources Company PXD has a strong presence in the low-cost oil-rich Midland basin — a sub-basin of the broader Permian. The #2 Ranked upstream energy player has a massive inventory of premium wells that will likely generate significant returns for the company.Pioneer Natural is focused on returning capital to shareholders. This includes a substantial variable dividend along with a strong base dividend. PXD is also employing opportunistic share repurchases to reward shareholders.Pioneer Natural has considerably lower exposure to debt capital than the composite stocks belonging to the industry. This reflects PXD’s strong balance sheet on which the firm can rely to sail through the volatile energy businesses.Improving oil prices is a boon for Matador Resources Company’s MTDR upstream operations. This is because MTDR has a strong presence in oil-rich core acres of the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring plays in the Delaware Basin. Favorable oil price is likely to aid it in increasing production volumes. For 2022, the upstream energy player with a Zacks Rank of 1 expects total production at 37,300 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (MBoE), higher than 31,454 MBoE in 2021. In fact, since 2019, total production has been increasing persistently, contributing to the top and the bottom line.On another positive note, Matador plans to turn to sales a net of 69.7 wells this year, including operated and non-operated wells. Among the prime priorities that MTDR has set for this year are lowering debt levels, delivering free cashflows and maintaining or increasing dividends.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Production has been suspended since September.CF Industries will keep its Billingham facility open after the Government stepped in to secure a rescue deal for the plant with the company's suppliers.Brett Nightingales, UK managing director of CF Fertilisers, said: ""As a high-cost producer in an intensely competitive global industry, we see considerable challenges to long-term sustainability from our current operational approach.""Nick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processors Association, said: ""You'd sooner have two plants rather than one, because if something goes wrong with that one plant you're in trouble.""It's important to keep that Billingham plant open and running. You feel way more vulnerable to what happens there, you only need one thing to go wrong there. It leaves the whole industry a lot more vulnerable, that's for certain. We are becoming more dependent on individual points in the supply chain.""Tom Bradshaw, deputy president of the National Farmers' Union, said: ""Today's announcement from CF Fertilisers is a further blow for farmers who are already suffering from incredibly high inflation for fertiliser costs.""This comes at a time when costs and supply face unprecedented risk. This closure is likely to further restrict global supply and we are seeking urgent clarification from CF Fertilisers on the production capabilities of its remaining plant at Billingham.""Jo Gilbertson, head of fertilisers at the Agricultural Industries Confederation, said: ""This is very sad and disappointing news. Nitrogen fertiliser is the meat in a balanced diet for plants.""This will affect all sorts of things. If we don't have access to nitrogen fertilisers it affects everything from the cost of milk and meat products on the shelves to the price of bread because milling wheat needs the high protein level you get from nitrogen. Then you have to import grain and there's a shortage of that because of the crisis in Ukraine.""Then there are the knock-on effects. Carbon dioxide is a byproduct and it is also valuable for the food supply chain. The whole food chain grinds to a halt if the carbon dioxide is now unavailable, from meat processing plants not being operational to hospitals having to cancel operations because they use it for surgery. We have a resilience issue now. The fact that Billingham has lost a twin means there's only one factory producing now rather than two.""The NFU has warned high fertiliser prices will deter farmers from growing the wheat required for making bread. The cost of fertiliser has risen from around £200 per ton before the pandemic to around £625 per ton in recent months.Minette Batters, president of the NFU, said farmers will be pushed to cut back, deciding “I will not run the risk will not run the risk of such massive investment trying to produce milling wheat, I will produce for the [livestock] feed wheat market, I can cut half my costs out”.""Some countries are incentivising the production of milling wheat. It will be pretty essential that we keep stocks high in order to fill the gap left by Russia and Ukraine on the global market,” she said, adding it is ""essential"" to keep stocks high due to a lack of wheat exports from Russia and Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine supply 30pc of all global wheat exports, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.A poor harvest in China has also prompted India to ban wheat exports to ensure it has enough grain for its own population.Ms Batters said: ""There will be some people thinking we can just import what we cannot produce, but that is not a given. There is going to be a global shortage in some areas.""The major bank has wasted no time passing on the rate rise to customers. Here’s what the other big banks are likely to do.As interest rates rise and property prices stagnate, many first-home buyers are thinking now might be the time to get into the market.

The company has outperformed its industry’s rise of 44.5% over the same time frame. It has also topped the S&P 500’s roughly 12.1% decline over the same period.Let’s take a look into the factors that are driving this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCF Industries is gaining from higher nitrogen fertilizer demand in major markets. Global demand for nitrogen is expected to remain strong in 2022. Higher crop commodity prices are contributing to healthy demand globally. Industrial demand has also recovered from the pandemic-related disruptions. In 2022, demand for nitrogen is expected to be driven by favorable industrial and economic activities and high levels of corn planted acres in the United States. Demand for urea imports from Brazil and India is also expected to be strong this year. Higher crop prices, high levels of planted corn acres and improved farm economics are likely to increase demand in Brazil.The company, on its first-quarter call, said that it sees strong global nitrogen industry dynamics for the foreseeable future with robust global nitrogen demand along with tight nitrogen supply worldwide and wide energy differentials between North America and marginal production in Europe and Asia. The company is also benefiting from higher nitrogen prices on the back of lower supply resulting from reduced operating rates across Europe and Asia due to higher energy prices. Higher nitrogen prices are driving its sales as witnessed in the last-reported quarter. The positive pricing environment is expected to continue moving ahead. Global nitrogen supply is expected to remain challenged due to higher energy prices in Europe and Asia along with export restrictions across certain countries.CF Industries also remains committed to boosting shareholders’ value by leveraging strong cash flows. It generated cash flow from operations of $1,391 million in the first quarter, up around 141% year over year. The company repurchased around 1.3 million shares for $100 million during the quarter. Its board also raised its quarterly dividend by 33% to 40 cents per share.  CF Industries Holdings, Inc. price-consensus-chart | CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

The site, which hasn’t produced ammonia since September, was one of CF’s plants halted last year as soaring gas costs squeezed profitability. That prompted the government to step in to help keep some operations going.The move to close the factory highlights the challenge that expensive gas poses to European industries. The threat to fertilizer output has also been bad news for the food and drink sector, because the factories produce carbon dioxide as a byproduct. That gas is used to stun pigs and chickens for slaughter, extend the shelf life of fresh food and give beer and soda their fizz.Fertilizer output at CF’s Billingham and Ince sites has provided as much as 60% of Britain’s CO2 production. The UK government has called the gas an “essential component of the national economy.”Gas prices have eased from a record, but are still 50% above usual for this time of year. High prices are expected to continue into winter and the risk still remains of further supply cutoffs from Russia. Prices will stay high for the next two years, according to ING Bank NV.CF said it would focus its UK manufacturing operations at its Billingham plant, which is the UK’s largest ammonia, ammonium nitrate and CO2 site. That facility is better positioned for long-term sustainability as it has sufficient capacity to meet all domestic demand, it said.Even before the energy price crisis, the company’s fertilizer sales were lagging behind due to competition from lower-cost international supplies. Muted demand in the UK has meant that CF has been forced to export at “unsustainably low margins” in order to continue to operate both facilities, the company said.“As carbon costs continue to increase substantially in the UK, the company expects that its production will be placed at an even larger competitive disadvantage against imports,” CF said in a statement.Fertilizer demand is expected to fall further in the UK this year, according to CRU Group. Whatever gap is created by the closing of Ince is likely to be filled by import of other nitrogen products like ammonia nitrate and urea, analyst Shruti Kashyap said.The shutdown of Ince could lead to as many as 283 redundancies, the company said.(Updates with detail from the seventh paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe IRS Is Coming for Your Venmo IncomeSheryl Sandberg’s Legacy Is an Internet of Targeted, Automated AdsAmerica’s Inequality Problem Just Improved for the First Time in a GenerationUkraine’s Tactics Are Showing Smaller Countries How to Fight BackWe’re All Bargain Hunters Now That the Market’s Growth Spurt Is Over©2022 Bloomberg L.P.Aussies are taking on extra jobs to make ends meet but risk ending up with a debt at tax time if they make this one small mistake.

(NYSE: CF), today announced proposals to restructure its operations in the United Kingdom to position the business for long-term profitability and sustainability and enable it to continue to supply fertiliser, carbon dioxide and other industrial products to its domestic customers.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220607006350/en/Aerial view of CF Fertilisers UK's Ince manufacturing facility near Chester, United Kingdom (Photo: Business Wire)Summary:CF Fertilisers UK proposes to focus its manufacturing operations in the UK exclusively at the Billingham manufacturing facility in TeessideBillingham is the largest ammonia, ammonium nitrate (AN) and carbon dioxide (CO2) production facility in the countryThe Company believes that the facility is better positioned for long-term sustainability as it has sufficient capacity to meet all forecasted domestic demand for AN fertiliser from CF Fertilisers UK, is more efficient than the Ince manufacturing facility, has an installed industrial customer base, and has the ability to import ammoniaAligned with this approach, the Company is proposing to:Permanently close the Ince manufacturing facility near Chester, which could result in up to 283 redundancies at the site; the Ince manufacturing facility has not produced ammonia since September 2021Adopt CF Industries’ global operating model for corporate functions, which could result in up to 55 redundancies; this would entail the permanent transfer of select business activities to CF Industries’ headquarters in the United States, with certain functions continuing to be performed in the UK to support the Billingham manufacturing facility and UK businessOptimise Billingham manufacturing operations by closing Billingham’s operations centre, which is a legacy of the multiple utilities and chemical businesses across the broader Billingham site, and reorganise the maintenance and support team, which could result in up to 33 redundancies at the facilityCF Fertilisers UK anticipates that some of the proposed redundancies might be avoided by redeployment opportunities.The Company will be entering into collective redundancy consultation with its recognised union, Unite, and elected employee representatives regarding its redundancy proposalsAdditionally, in order to provide greater resilience to operational issues, low-priced imports and macro-economic forces, the Company will:Enter into a separate consultation process under applicable pensions legislation, including with its pension trustees, regarding a proposal to reduce the maximum employer contribution level for the defined contribution (DC) pension scheme; there are no changes proposed for defined benefit (DB) pension schemesDiscuss proposed revisions to current pay and conditions arrangements with Unite""The people and facilities that make up CF Fertilisers UK are part of a proud, 100-year history of providing customers in the UK with products vital to the country’s food security and industrial activity,"" said Brett Nightingale, managing director, CF Fertilisers UK. ""However, as a high-cost producer in an intensely competitive global industry, we see considerable challenges to long-term sustainability from our current operational approach. Following a strategic review of our business, we believe that the best way to continue our legacy of serving customers in the UK is to operate only the Billingham manufacturing facility moving forward while addressing cost pressures throughout our business.""We expect to begin collective redundancy consultation with union and other employee representatives shortly. We intend to provide our team with all possible support through what we recognise will be a very challenging time for them.""Commercial Environment OverviewGlobal nitrogen industry conditions are expected to remain challenging for nitrogen producers in the UK and Europe. The cost of producing nitrogen fertilisers is highly dependent on the cost of natural gas, which is the principal raw material and primary fuel source used in the ammonia production process for manufacturing facilities in the region. For many producers globally, more than 70% of the total cost to produce ammonia is from the cost of natural gas. Natural gas forward curves suggest that nitrogen facilities in the UK and Europe will be the world’s high-cost marginal producers for the foreseeable future, presenting a constant challenge to the sustainability of current operations.Operations at both the Billingham and Ince manufacturing facilities were halted in September 2021 due to high natural gas prices that made production at the sites unprofitable. The Billingham manufacturing facility was subsequently restarted that month following an interim agreement reached with the UK government to cover the costs associated with restarting the ammonia plant to produce CO2 for the UK market. Since September 2021, no redundancies have been made at the business and all CF Fertilisers UK employees have been paid full salaries and bonuses, with payroll-related expenses totaling approximately £35 million during that time, several times larger than the government support provided.Against this backdrop, a strategic review was recently completed that confirmed additional challenges facing the business.The Company’s AN fertiliser sales volumes to domestic customers have fallen by nearly 30 percent since the 2017-18 season due to intense competition from lower-cost imports. As a result, when both plants are producing AN even at minimum levels, the Company has not been able to profitably sell the entire volume domestically over the last four years. This has caused CF Fertilisers UK to increasingly turn to exporting at unsustainably low margins in order to continue to operate both facilities. As carbon costs continue to increase substantially in the UK, the Company expects that its production will be placed at an even larger competitive disadvantage against imports without a carbon border adjustment mechanism to ensure a level playing field.As a result of the strategic review, CF Fertilisers UK believes that only one manufacturing facility is needed to fulfill the domestic demand it has been serving. In this scenario, the Company expects Billingham to be best positioned for the longer-term:Billingham has the capacity to produce enough AN to meet all forecasted domestic customer demand.Billingham has a meaningful volume of ammonia and nitric acid industrial contracts that pass-through the cost of natural gas to customers, providing a foundation for profitable operations.The facility has a lower production cost per tonne as it is 10-20% more efficient than the Ince manufacturing facility and is a less-capital intensive facility than Ince as it has fewer production facilitiesBillingham has additional operational flexibility from a 40,000-ton ammonia storage tank and the ability to import lower-cost ammonia if necessary.The facility is also able to supply a substantial volume of CO2 to industrial gas customers, though this has become less important to its future as industrial gas customers diversify their CO2 supply away from CF Fertilisers UK.Redundancy Consultation Process TimingCF Fertilisers UK has sent notification to employees of the restructuring proposals and will be holding employee meetings over the next two days. The Company also has shared information about the proposals with Unite, which represents 442 CF Fertilisers UK employees, and with pension trustees. CF Fertilisers UK will be submitting the relevant Form HR1 filings to the UK government today. The redundancy consultation process will formally commence following the election of representatives for employees who are not represented by Unite. None of the proposed redundancies would take effect until at least 45 days following the start of the consultation.At this time, the information detailed in this press release are the Company’s proposals and no decisions will be undertaken without engaging in the required consultation processes. Management cannot preempt the outcome of the consultation process.Notes to EditorsCF Fertilisers UK OverviewCF Fertilisers UK was formed in 2015 following the purchase by CF Industries of the 50 percent equity interest in GrowHow UK Limited that it did not already own. CF Fertilisers UK’s current operations include the Billingham and Ince manufacturing facilities, as well as a corporate office located at Ince.Both manufacturing facilities produce ammonia as their base product, which can either be sold as ammonia itself or upgraded to other nitrogen products, including AN and nitric acid. The Company also offers products manufactured at Ince – NS and NPKs – that have historically made a minimal contribution to gross margin. This is a situation that is not expected to improve due to a significant increase in the price of the raw materials – ammonium sulfate, phosphoric acid, potash – used to make the products.As of June 1, 2022, CF Fertilisers UK employed 544 individuals – 177 at the Billingham manufacturing facility, 283 at the Ince manufacturing facility and 84 in corporate functions. Since 2015, CF Industries has invested nearly £200 million of capital into CF Fertilisers UK’s manufacturing facilities.Facilities Overview BillinghamInceFirst ammonia production1924NOTE: The ammonia plant currently in use was built in the 1970s1965Facility Footprint1 ammonia plant, 1 AN plant, 3 nitric acid plants1 ammonia plant, 1 AN plant, 3 nitric acid plants, 3 NPK plantsAverage Annual Capacity(1)(short tons)  Gross ammonia(2)595,000380,000Net ammonia(3)230,00015,000Ammonium nitrate(4)625,000575,000Nitric acid product tons410,0000NPKs(5)0415,000Storage Capacity(short tons)  Ammonia40,00011,000Ammonium Nitrate128,00095,000NPKs040,000Source: CF Industries 2021 Form 10-K(1) Average annual capacity includes allowances for normal outages and planned maintenance shutdowns(2) Gross ammonia capacity includes ammonia used to produce upgraded products.(3) Net ammonia capacity is gross ammonia capacity less ammonia used to produce upgraded products based on the product mix shown in the table.(4) The production of Nitrogen Sulphur (NS) at Ince is included in the ammonium nitrate production capacity figures for that facility.

399,"Some have more dollars than sense, they say, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can easily find investors. But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.'So if you're like me, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like EPAM Systems (NYSE:EPAM). Even if the shares are fully valued today, most capitalists would recognize its profits as the demonstration of steady value generation. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, but time is often a friend of the profitable company, especially if it is growing. View our latest analysis for EPAM Systems If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS). That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Impressively, EPAM Systems has grown EPS by 23% per year, compound, in the last three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away winners.I like to see top-line growth as an indication that growth is sustainable, and I look for a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin to point to a competitive moat (though some companies with low margins also have moats). EPAM Systems maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 49% to US$4.1b. That's a real positive.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.While we live in the present moment at all times, there's no doubt in my mind that the future matters more than the past. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for EPAM Systems?Since EPAM Systems has a market capitalization of US$17b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a glittering mountain of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$534m. I would find that kind of skin in the game quite encouraging, if I owned shares, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience my success, or failure, with the stock.It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Well, based on the CEO pay, I'd say they are indeed. For companies with market capitalizations over US$8.0b, like EPAM Systems, the median CEO pay is around US$13m.The EPAM Systems CEO received total compensation of just US$5.9m in the year to . That looks like modest pay to me, and may hint at a certain respect for the interests of shareholders. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.You can't deny that EPAM Systems has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. If that's not enough, consider also that the CEO pay is quite reasonable, and insiders are well-invested alongside other shareholders. This may only be a fast rundown, but the takeaway for me is that EPAM Systems is worth keeping an eye on. We should say that we've discovered 2 warning signs for EPAM Systems that you should be aware of before investing here.You can invest in any company you want.

(NYSE: SJM) today announced results for the fourth quarter of its 2022 fiscal year ending April 30, 2022. Financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year reflect the divestitures of the natural beverage and grains businesses on January 31, 2022, the private label dry pet food business on December 1, 2021, the Natural Balance® business on January 29, 2021, and the Crisco® business on December 1, 2020. All comparisons are to the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year, unless otherwise noted.EXECUTIVE SUMMARYNet sales increased $113.6 million, or 6 percent. Net sales excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign currency exchange increased 9 percent.For the full year, net sales were $8.0 billion, in-line with the prior year. Net sales excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign currency exchange increased 5 percent.Net income per diluted share for the quarter was $1.87. Adjusted earnings per share was $2.23, an increase of 18 percent.For the full year, net income per diluted share was $5.83. Adjusted earnings per share was $8.88, a decrease of 3 percent.Cash from operations was $393.7 million compared to $291.0 million in the prior year. Free cash flow was $220.7 million in the quarter and $718.8 million for the full year.Return of capital to shareholders, reflecting cash dividends and share repurchases, was $369.7 million in the quarter and $688.5 million for the full year.The Company provided its fiscal year 2023 outlook, with an expected net sales increase of 3.5 to 4.5 percent, adjusted earnings per share to range from $7.85 to $8.25, and free cash flow of $500 million.Guidance reflects an estimated unfavorable impact to sales of 2 percent and adjusted earnings per share of $0.90 related to the recall of certain Jif® peanut butter products.CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER REMARKS""Our fourth quarter and full-year results demonstrate the continued execution of our strategy and momentum of the business, amid a challenging and dynamic environment. Our strong financial results reflect sustained consumer demand for at-home food and coffee and consumers' desire for our trusted and iconic brands,"" said Mark Smucker, President and Chief Executive Officer. ""During the year, we also made significant progress in strengthening our financial position, as we reduced our debt balance, while also returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.""""Looking ahead to fiscal year 2023, we are focused on continuing the momentum of the business, investing in growth focused platforms such as Uncrustables®, partnering with retailers to restock Jif® products following the recent recall, and supporting our talented employees who are instrumental to our success. With strong underlying momentum across our portfolio of brands, we remain confident in our ability to execute our strategic priorities and support long-term shareholder value creation.""FOURTH QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS(A)Three Months Ended April 30,20222021% Increase (Decrease)(Dollars and shares in millions, except per share data)Net sales$2,033.8$1,920.26%Operating income$302.0$238.727%Adjusted operating income350.9311.613%Net income per common share – assuming dilution$1.87$1.3539%Adjusted earnings per share – assuming dilution2.231.8918%Weighted-average shares outstanding – assuming dilution107.8108.9(1)%(A) Subsequent to April 30, 2022, we initiated a voluntary recall of select Jif® peanut butter products produced at our Lexington, Kentucky, facility and sold primarily in the U.S. due to potential salmonella contamination. As a result, we recorded reserves of $52.3 million in our consolidated financial statements as of April 30, 2022, within our U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segment, which was inclusive of unsaleable inventory, estimated customer returns, and consumer refunds. We anticipate these costs will be recovered by insurance, and as a result, an insurance receivable of $49.8 million, net of the deductible, was also recorded as of April 30, 2022.Based on our best estimates, in fiscal year 2023, we anticipate an additional unfavorable impact of approximately $125.0 million, net of the remaining anticipated insurance recoveries, primarily related to the estimated impact of manufacturing downtime, customer returns, and unsaleable inventory, as well as other recall related costs. The ultimate impact from the Jif® peanut butter recall could differ materially from these estimates.Net SalesNet sales increased 6 percent, including a 1 percent unfavorable impact of estimated customer returns related to the Jif® peanut butter product recall. Excluding noncomparable net sales in the prior year of $59.9 million for the divested private label dry pet food and natural beverage and grains businesses, as well as a decreased contribution from foreign currency exchange of $0.7 million, net sales increased $174.2 million, or 9 percent.The increase in comparable net sales was primarily driven by a 10 percentage point increase from net price realization, driven by each of the Company's business segments, reflecting list price increases. The favorable net price realization was partially offset by a 1 percentage point decrease from volume/mix.Operating IncomeGross profit decreased $69.0 million, or 9 percent, including a 7 percent unfavorable impact of unsaleable inventory and estimated customer returns related to the Jif® peanut butter product recall as of April 30, 2022. The decline reflects the impact of the Jif® peanut butter product recall, the noncomparable impact related to divestitures, and a decreased contribution from volume/mix. Higher costs, primarily driven by increased commodity and ingredient, packaging, and manufacturing costs were offset by higher net price realization. Operating income increased $63.3 million, or 27 percent, as a $58.5 million decrease in selling, distribution, and administrative (""SD&A"") expenses and a $16.1 million decrease in other special project costs offset the gross profit decline. Operating income also reflects an anticipated insurance recovery, net of deductible, that mostly offsets the unfavorable impact of unsaleable inventory, estimated customer returns, and consumer refunds related to the Jif® peanut butter product recall as of April 30, 2022.Adjusted gross profit decreased $71.8 million, or 10 percent, with the difference from results based on generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") being the exclusion of the change in net cumulative unallocated derivative gains and losses and special project costs. Adjusted operating income increased $39.3 million, or 13 percent, further reflecting the exclusion of other special project costs.Interest Expense and Income TaxesNet interest expense decreased $4.4 million, primarily as a result of reduced debt outstanding as compared to the prior year.The effective income tax rate was 22.3 percent, compared to 24.0 percent in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, the adjusted effective income tax rate was 22.3 percent, compared to 23.3 percent in the prior year. The prior year effective tax rates included Canadian withholding tax on a nonrecurring cash dividend repatriated during the fourth quarter.Cash Flow and DebtCash provided by operating activities was $393.7 million, compared to $291.0 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting a decrease in cash used for income and other taxes, an increase in net income adjusted for noncash items, and a decrease in cash required to fund working capital, as compared to the prior year. Free cash flow was $220.7 million, compared to $183.0 million in the prior year, as the increase in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by a $65.0 million increase in capital expenditures.The Company repurchased 2.0 million common shares for $262.7 million in the fourth quarter.FULL-YEAR OUTLOOKThe Company provided its full-year fiscal year 2023 guidance as summarized below:Net sales increase vs prior year3.5% - 4.5%Adjusted earnings per share$7.85 - $8.25Free cash flow (in millions)$500Capital expenditures (in millions)$550Adjusted effective tax rate24.2%The pandemic and its related implications, along with ongoing cost inflation and volatility in supply chains, continue to impact financial results and cause uncertainty and risk for the fiscal year 2023 outlook. Any manufacturing or supply chain disruption, as well as changes in consumer purchasing behavior, retailer inventory levels, and broader macroeconomic conditions, could materially impact actual results. In particular, the recent Jif® peanut butter product recall will impact our financial results for the fiscal year. While the outlook remains uncertain, the Company continues to focus on managing the elements it can control, including taking the necessary steps to minimize the impact of cost inflation, the product recall, and any additional business disruption. This guidance reflects performance expectations based on the Company's current understanding of the overall environment, inclusive of the estimated unfavorable impact of the product recall.Net sales are expected to increase 3.5 to 4.5 percent compared to the prior year. Excluding noncomparable net sales in the prior year for the divested private label dry pet food and natural beverage and grains businesses, net sales are expected to increase approximately 6 percent at the mid-point of the guidance range. This reflects higher net pricing to recover cost inflation across multiple categories, partially offset by the anticipated volume/mix impact of price elasticity of demand, and a 2 percent unfavorable impact related to estimated manufacturing downtime and customer returns from the Jif® peanut butter product recall.Adjusted earnings per share is expected to range from $7.85 to $8.25, including a $0.90 estimated unfavorable impact related to the Jif® peanut butter product recall. This range reflects the benefits of higher net pricing actions and shares repurchased in the prior year being more than offset by cost inflation, the anticipated volume/mix impact of price elasticity of demand, the unfavorable impact of the Jif® peanut butter product recall, and increased SD&A expenses. This guidance assumes an adjusted gross profit margin range of 33.0 to 34.0 percent, including a 1 percent estimated unfavorable impact related to the Jif® peanut butter product recall, an adjusted effective income tax rate of 24.2 percent, and 106.5 million common shares outstanding. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $500 million, inclusive of the estimated unfavorable impact related to the Jif® peanut butter product recall, with capital expenditures of $550 million.FOURTH QUARTER SEGMENT RESULTSDollar amounts in the segment tables below are reported in millions.U.S. Retail Pet FoodsNet SalesSegment ProfitSegment Profit MarginFY22 Q4 Results$718.1$120.716.8%Increase (decrease) vs prior year6%19%170bpsNet sales increased $43.5 million, or 6 percent.

But the outlook isn't as clear on September, when the Fed could return to a more typical quarter-point move or take a pause, depending on the direction of the economic data it gets.Analysts expect the monthly gain in CPI to be 0.7%, after 0.3% the prior month. The yearly gain is expected to be 8.3%, which is the same as the previous 12-month gain. What everyone wants to see is evidence inflation has plateaued.But before that a few more data points will come out, including the Fed's report on consumer credit, due out Tuesday morning.People will be watching Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR) this week, as well. Apple held its Worldwide Developers Conference, rolling out new MacBooks powered by its next-generation M2 chip, as well as new functionality for iPhones and other devices. Meanwhile, Twitter is in the spotlight as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk makes noise about his multi-billion-dollar deal to buy the social media company.Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:1. Consumer creditAt 10 AM ET, the Fed will release its consumer credit data for April. Analysts expect it to say credit rose $35 billion to a record $4.6 trillion. But that monthly reading would be lower than both March and February readings.2. J.M. Smucker earningsWhile earnings season has mostly wound down, there are still a couple of reports this week. The J.M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM) is expected to report EPS of $1.88 on revenue of $1.98 billion. Analysts will be listening to what the food company says about costs and labor.3.

This week’s list includes JM Smucker SJM, Campbell Soup CPB, Brown-Forman (BF.A),Kroger KR, and Adobe ADBE.It is reasonable for earnings estimates to be coming down in the face of Fed tightening. The reason for that is the 'second-derivative' effect, with higher interest rates resulting in slower economic growth, which in turn shows up in moderating revenue growth.There are some in the market that can't see the Fed getting on top of the inflation problem without pushing the economy into a recession. Variations of this view show up in public comments from business leaders along the lines of Jamie Dimon's 'hurricane' comment and Elon Musk's 'super bad feeling' about the economy.A recessionary outcome for the economy is neither the consensus view, nor what the Zacks economic team is projecting at present. What everyone agrees on, however, is that the economy should start slowing as the cumulative effect of higher interest rates seep through into the economy.We are not there yet, as the better-than-expected May jobs report showed on Friday. But we are starting to see some tell-tale signs of moderation, with some companies announcing hiring freezes or even lay-offs. Even the strong May jobs report showed some deceleration in wage gains. It is still early, but these signs suggest that the Fed's actions are steering the economy in the desirable direction.To get back to the 'second-derivative' effect of moderating economic growth, we note that while earnings estimates have come down a bit, they are nowhere near what would be consistent with a significant economic slowdown.For example, 2022 Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index companies are currently expected to increase +2.1% from the year-earlier level on +9.5% higher revenues.If we look at the revisions trend in the aggregate, at the S&P 500 level, we don't see a lot of movement, as you can see in the chart below that plots the evolution of aggregate Q2 earnings growth estimates for the index since the start of 2022.That said, there are plenty of cross-currents at the sector level, with positive revisions to the Energy sector offsetting declines in most other sectors.Second quarter 2022 earnings estimates for the Zacks Energy sector have increased +45.2% since the start of April.Energy is not the only sector that has enjoyed positive Q2 estimate revisions; there are 5 other sectors whose estimates have gone up in varying magnitudes. Since the start of Q2 on April 1st, earnings estimates have gone up for the Transportation, Basic Materials, Autos, Construction, and Consumer Staples sectors. Of these 5 sectors, the upgrade to the Q2 earnings outlook is particularly significant for the Transportation and Basic Materials sectors.If we look at the aggregate Q2 revisions, after excluding the Energy sector from the mix, then the picture changes.Pretty much the same trend is in play with the revisions trend on an annual basis, with aggregate estimates stable or even modestly up since the start of the year, but starting to come down on an ex-Energy basis.Any way you look at it, the Energy sector is in a good place at present, with a very strong earnings outlook.This Week's Earnings ResultsFor all practical purposes, the 2022 Q1 earnings season has come to an end. But it isn't over yet, with three S&P 500 members on deck to report Q1 results this week. These are JM Smucker, Campbell Soup and Brown-Forman.With results from 496 S&P 500 members already out, we will only have Kroger left after this week's results from these three index members. In fact, the day Kroger reports its quarterly results on June 16th, Adobe will be releasing its fiscal May-quarter results that we count as part of the 2022 Q2 tally.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>>Breaking Down the Tech Sector's Earnings OutlookWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Economists forecast the broadest measure of CPI rose by 8.3% in May, on par with April’s advance. Over the month, CPI is expected to show an increase of 0.7%, up from 0.2% last month.The core measure of the index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, likely decelerated to 0.5% on a monthly basis from 0.6% in April, and 5.9% annually from 6.2% the prior month.“The rate of inflation moderated a bit in April and we’ll need to see this followed up by more slowing in May to underscore the notion that inflation has peaked,” Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride said in emailed commentary. “Even then, it will take many months of more moderate price readings for the rate of inflation to come down in a meaningful way.”That sentiment has been shared among Federal Reserve policymakers as of late, including Vice Chair Lael Brainard. On Thursday, the central bank’s now No. 2 official said signaled half-percentage-point increases in interest rates this month and next were likely, along with continued tightening afterward.“Right now it’s very hard to see the case for a pause,” Brainard told CNBC in an interview Thursday. “We’ve still got a lot of work to do to get inflation down to our 2% target.”Fedspeak will hit a lull as officials enter a blackout period ahead of their next policy-setting meeting, set to take place June 14-15. A half percentage point interest rate hike appears likely to be announced following this discussion.Outside of Friday’s CPI print, investors are in for a light economic and earnings calendar next week, but volatility is expected to persist as Wall Street braces for tighter financial conditions and weighs a U.S. economy in limbo.All while government data shows a sharp contrast from what some corporate leaders see ahead.Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk warned of a ""super bad feeling"" about the economy, saying the company is expected to trim about 10% of jobs in an email to executives, Reuters reported Friday, while also motioning management to ""pause all hiring worldwide.""The comments echo remarks from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) boss Jamie Dimon, who cautioned of a ""hurricane"" bearing down on the U.S. economy and a weaker outlook reported by tech bellwether Microsoft (MSFT), which more specifically cited foreseen disruptions from volatility in currencies.Not all are convinced these warnings indicate an economy close to rolling over. As Greg Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told Yahoo Finance on Friday, May's jobs data suggests this drumbeat of doom and gloom ahead is ""misleading"" in the context of a still-growing labor market.""While the economy will undoubtedly slow in the coming months, anecdotal evidence of hiring freezes and layoffs at tech companies is misleading with overall job openings still near record-highs and layoffs at record-lows,"" Daco said.—Monday: No notable reports scheduled for release.Tuesday: Trade Balance, April (-$89.2 billion expected, $108.9 billion during prior month); Revisions: Trade Balance; Consumer Credit, April ($32.750 billion expected, $52.435 billion during prior month)Wednesday: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended June 3 (-2.3% during prior week); Wholesale Trade Sales, month-over-month, April (1.7% during prior week); Wholesale Trade Inventories, month-over-month, April final (2.1% expected, 2.1% during prior week)Thursday: Initial Jobless Claims, week ended June 4 (200,000 during prior week); Continuing Claims, week ended May 28 (1.309 million during prior week); Household Change in Net Worth, 1Q ($529.7 billion); Bloomberg June United States Economic Survey.Friday: Consumer Price Index, month-over-month, May (0.7% expected, 0.3% during prior month); Core CPI, month-over-month, May (0.5% expected, 0.6% during prior month); Consumer Price Index, year-over-year, May (8.3% expected, 8.3% in during prior month); Core CPI, year-over-year, May (5.9% expected, 6.2% during prior month); Real Average Hourly Earnings, year-over-year, May (-2.6% during prior month), Real Average Weekly Earnings, year-over-year, May (-3.4% during prior month), University of Michigan Sentiment, June preliminary (58.7 expected, 58.4 during prior month); Monthly Budget Statement, May ($308.2 billion during prior month)—MondayBefore market open: No notable reports scheduled for release.After market close: Coupa Software (COUP)TuesdayBefore market open: The J.M.

The firm's restaurant, food service, and grocery-related investments have included Advantage Solutions (NASDAQ: ADV), Bloomin' Brands (NASDAQ: BLMN), Brakes Group Food Distribution, Burger King (NYSE: QSR), Dessert Holdings, Dunkin' Brands Inc., Domino's Pizza (NYSE: DPZ), Gail's Bakery, Retail Zoo, Skylark Restaurants, and Valeo Foods.The transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of 2022 and is subject to customary closing conditions.Moelis & Company LLC acted as exclusive financial advisor and sole placement agent and McDermott Will & Emery acted as legal advisor to Cuisine Solutions in connection with the transaction.

Renowned for its innovation, the Company has launched sous vide products across a wide spectrum of categories – including proteins, sauces, grain and plant-based products, and its hugely popular egg bites.  Their pasteurized sous vide items offer 18 months shelf life frozen, six days when defrosted, and can be oven finished in mere minutes. This allows food service and home cooks to save time, simplify the complexity of any supply chain challenges, and is a perfect solution to significantly reduce waste and labor costs. Headquartered in Sterling, Virginia, Cuisine Solutions services more than 22,000 restaurants and 6,000 retailers, as well as major airlines and hotels. For more information, visit www.cuisinesolutions.com.About Sous VideSous vide – French for ""under-vacuum"" – is an innovative cooking technique in which food is vacuum sealed and heated in water until cooked to perfection.  In 1971, Dr. Bruno Goussault (who would later become Chief Scientist at Cuisine Solutions) developed sous vide as a way of improving the texture and flavor, while maintaining the natural integrity of cooked foods. Dr. Goussault discovered that the sous vide approach – whereby food is slowly cooked at slightly-lower-than-usual temperature in specially designed, vacuum sealed pouches – resulted in notable flavor enhancement and a reduction in food shrinkage compared to conventional cooking methods. Cuisine Solutions' heritage in sous vide – and its continuous innovation in the science – has allowed the Company to consistently deliver restaurant-quality products that are trusted and favored by top chefs and discerning foodies around the world.About Bain CapitalBain Capital, LP is one of the world's leading private multi-asset alternative investment firms that creates lasting impact for our investors, teams, businesses, and the communities in which we live.
