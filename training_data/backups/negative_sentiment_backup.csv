2,2,"It has been a choppy first half of the week for XRP. Two consecutive days in the green reversed a Monday sell-off, leaving XRP up 0.09% for the week.Reaction to the Fed rate hike and forward guidance delivered support on Wednesday, while the SEC v Ripple case remains the key driver.Technical indicators remain bearish, with XRP sitting below the 50-day EMA.On Wednesday, XRP rallied by 6.81%. Following a 3.28% rise on Tuesday, XRP ended the day at $0.3433.A choppy day saw XRP fall through the First Major Support Level at $0.3011 to a day low of $0.2990 before making a move.In response to the Fed monetary policy decision and Fed Chair Powell’s press conference, XRP struck a day high of $0.3461.XRP broke through the First Major Resistance Level at $0.3339 to wrap up the day at $0.34. The Second Major Resistance Level, at $0.3465, pegged XRP back from more material gains.While the Fed and Fed Chair Powell delivered support, the ongoing SEC v Ripple case remains the key driver.This week, investors await a court ruling that could be a defining moment in the case. A court ruling in favor of Ripple Lab could force the SEC into a settlement and place a big question mark over the SEC’s stance on cryptos and the Howey test.This week, SEC and Ripple await a court ruling on whether William Hinman’s speech-related documents fall under the attorney-client privilege.In 2018, the former SEC Director of the Division of Corporation Finance said that bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH) are not securities.On Tuesday, June 7, the SEC and Ripple attended a court-scheduled conference. Judge Sarah Netburn scheduled the meeting to focus on the SEC’s claims that all documents relating to William Hinman’s 2018 speech should fall under the attorney-client privilege.Before last week’s conference, the SEC filed at least six motions attempting to shield the Hinman speech-related documents under the attorney-client privilege.The Ripple defense team and the XRP holders hope for a favorable court ruling. The general consensus is that the documents contain details that could damage the SEC case.William Hinman has, inadvertently, become a central figure in the SEC v Ripple case.In December, Empower Oversight, a non-profit government watchdog, filed a lawsuit against the SEC. The lawsuit claimed that William Hinman received millions of dollars from his former employer, Simpson Thacher.Simpson Thacher is part of a group that promotes Enterprise Ethereum. Empower Oversight claimed that the Hinman speech caused an ETH price spike before the SEC lawsuit against Ripple Lab, claiming that XRP is a security.At the time of writing, XRP was down 2.10% to $0.3361.A mixed morning saw XRP rise to an early morning high of $0.3470 before falling to a low of $0.3342.XRP left the Major Support and Resistance Levels untested early on.Avoiding a fall through the $0.3294 pivot would target the First Major Resistance Level at $0.3600. XRP will need the broader crypto market support to breakout from the 50-day EMA, currently at $0.3483.In the case of a broad-based crypto rebound, XRP should test resistance at the 100-day EMA, currently at $0.3700. The Second Major Resistance Level sits at $0.3766.A fall through the pivot would bring the First Major Support Level at $0.3130 into play. Barring an extended sell-off throughout the afternoon, XRP should avoid sub-$0.30. The Second Major Support Level sits at $0.2824.The EMAs and the 4-hourly candlestick chart (below) send a bearish signal. At the time of writing, XRP sat below the 50-day EMA, currently at $0.3483. Today, the 50-day EMA fell back from the 100-day EMA. The 100-day EMA eased back from the 200-day EMA, XRP price negative.A return to $0.35 levels would support a run at the 100-day EMA. Near term, the SEC v Ripple court ruling on the Hinman docs will be the key driver.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireYemeni journalist killed in car blast in AdenShares and bonds hit as Swiss rate hike adds to policy angstMeta, Google, Twitter pledge to better fight fake news or risk finesAudi files lawsuit against Chinese EV maker Nio over trademark rights – HandelsblattEDF hopeful end in sight for long-delayed, budget-busting nuclear plantSri Lanka to receive new petrol shipment within three days – ministerIt was a bullish session for the crypto market on Wednesday, with bitcoin and ethereum ending their extended losing streaks, supported by the Fed.Bitcoin miners appear to be preparing to offload large amounts of the asset as flows to exchanges peaked this week.After a week of announcements in NSW to improve the affordability of childcare and early learning, today Victorian parents are getting a turn.

BTC prices have slumped a whopping 25% over the past seven days, and the pain may not be over yet.On-chain metrics have revealed that Bitcoin miners have been sending more of the asset to exchanges, with a new all-time high of 88,000 BTC sent on June 15, according to CoinMetrics.The analytics platform also noted an all-time high in dollar terms with a net $1.94 billion worth of BTC sent to exchanges yesterday.On-chain data provider Glassnode confirmed the findings reporting that the seven-day moving average of miners to exchange flow just reached a seven-month high of 9.47 BTC.When miners move large amounts of Bitcoin to centralized exchanges, it is usually a sign that they are preparing to liquidate. Exchange inflows mean BTC is being transferred to a place where it can be quickly converted into stablecoins or fiat.Rising energy costs worldwide will also have a major impact on mining revenue, so they may be attempting to offset some of those expenses by selling the asset.Bitcoin mining profitability has tanked to its lowest level since October 2020, according to Bitinfocharts. Since the crypto market peak in November 2021, the metric has fallen by 80%, from 0.45 USD per day per terahash per second to under USD 0.10/day per TH/s.Consequently, mining revenue has fallen to its lowest level for a year. Daily revenue is currently around $22.5 million, down 70% from the $74.4 million they were earning in October 2021, according to Blockchain.com.Bitcoin hash rate often referred to as the computing horsepower for the network, remains close to its all-time high, however, at 226 EH/s (exahashes per second). Mining difficulty is also near peak levels which have compounded those revenue and profitability woes.Castle Island Ventures partner, Nic Carter, saw the bright side suggesting that it was a sign markets were near the bottom.“Miner selling was a key catalyst I was looking for to signal the bottom, granted it’s not over, but it’s important that a lot of it apparently happened already,”The concern is that this significant miner sell-off could cause a final capitulation event dumping crypto asset prices even further. BTC has regained the $22,500 price level during Thursday morning’s Asian trading session, but a big miner offload is likely to send it crashing below $20K quickly.Bitcoin is currently 67% down from its all-time high, so there is likely to be more pain before the bears are finished since previous market cycles saw drawdowns of more than 80%.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireGhislaine Maxwell’s lawyers urge leniency ahead of sex trafficking sentencingWHO looks into reports of monkeypox virus in semenFed rolls out biggest rate hike since 1994, flags slowing economyIndia records 12,213 new daily cases of COVID-19SEC v Ripple: XRP Revisits $0.34 as Investors Await Court RulingRevlon files for bankruptcy protectionBitcoin price dives to $20,000, Ethereum’s ether tested the $1,000 zone, and BNB is struggling to stay above the key $200 support.It was a bullish session for the crypto market on Wednesday, with bitcoin and ethereum ending their extended losing streaks, supported by the Fed.Following Wednesday’s Fed monetary policy decision and forward guidance, XRP investor focus returns to the SEC v Ripple case.

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ended their extended losing streaks.The bullish session came despite the Fed delivering the largest rate hike since 1994 to curb inflation.Another choppy session saw the total crypto market cap fall by $84 billion to a new current-year low of $834bn before bouncing back.It was a bullish session for the crypto market on Wednesday. The broader market responded favorably to the highly anticipated Fed monetary policy decision, with bitcoin (BTC) ending an eight-day losing streak.Bitcoin was heading for a ninth day in the red with a fall to a new current year low of $20,084 before finding late support.Investor reaction to the Fed monetary policy decision tested bitcoin support late in the day before bitcoin tracked the NASDAQ into positive territory.After eight consecutive days in the red, the total crypto market cap recovered from another slide to end the day up $27 billion.Tracking gains across the US equity markets, the broader crypto market responded favorably to the Fed rate hike and FOMC projections.The total market cap fell to a new 2022 low of $834 billion before a move through to $950 billion levels. $84 billion came off the table before a broad-based crypto market rebound.While the broader crypto market responded favorably to the Fed, downside risks linger.Near-term, these include an anticipated shift in the regulatory landscape and the threat of a global economic slowdown.From the top ten cryptos, SOL rallied by 17.47% to lead the way, with ADA (+10.79%) and DOGE (+12.96%) close behind.BNB (+4.76%), BTC (+2.03), ETH (+2.39%), and XRP (+6.55%) also found support.From the CoinMarketCap top 100, UNUS SED LEO (LEO) and Bitcoin SV (BSV) bucked the broader market trend, falling by 7.51% and 6.26%, respectively.Tron (TRX) found much-needed support, with a 13.31% rally reversing a 12.99% slide from Tuesday.A steadying in the USDD and news of the TRON DAO Reserve making moves to reestablish the dollar peg, easing market nerves.While the USDD continued to sit below $0.98, the collateral ratio stood at 317.88%.Following Tuesday’s spike, total liquidations eased back further going into the Thursday session.According to Coinglass, 24-hour liquidations stood at $538 million, down from $578 million levels on the day prior. While down from the Tuesday jump to $1,070, however, 24-hour liquidation levels remained elevated.One-hour liquidations pointed to a steadying in market cap conditions, with one-hour liquidations at $11.78 million.SEC sent letters to crypto exchanges to establish whether the appropriate safeguards are in place to tackle insider trading.Fed delivered the largest rate hike since 1994.

Bitcoin’s price had been on a downtrend since June 9.Still, in European hours Wednesday, the world’s largest cryptocurrency fell as much as 7.8% to $20,289, its lowest since December 2020.On June 15, BTC tumbled to a new 18-month low, dragging altcoins with it and deepening a market meltdown sparked by crypto lender Celsius this week, freezing customer withdrawals.The top cryptocurrency has lost over 31% in the last week and more than half its value this year. BTC’s price has slumped by over 70% from its all-time high price of nearly $69,000 made in November 2021.Bitcoin’s fall below the crucial $20,000 support could assist further downward price momentum. A fall in BTC’s price below the crucial psychological support levels of $25,000 and $22,500 has spread distress across crypto and traditional markets.Shockingly, the price of the largest cryptocurrency by market value has been in a downtrend for nine straight days – a record losing streak in pricing data going back to the early 2010s.After a minor recovery wave was seen in the early hours of Wednesday as bitcoin price saw a fresh round of selling from $22,000. The price declined and broke the $20,500 support, leading to further sell-offs in the market amid extreme fear.The top crypto asset traded close to the $20,000 level and settled below the 21 simple moving average. For bitcoin bulls, a push in price aimed at a recovery above the $21,000 level would be critical.Notably, BTC price faced a significant resistance near the $21,600 level and the 21 simple moving average, as highlighted in a recent FXEmpire article.The next major resistance for bitcoin is at $22,800; however, looking at the market a revisit of the under $20,000 zone could be expected in the near term.Data from Glassnode highlights that bitcoin mining profitability has dropped by over 75% from the market top and is currently at its lowest since October 2020.Bitcoin Miners to Exchange flow rose to a seven-month high of 9,476. This meant that miners sent an abnormally high volume of BTC to crypto exchanges amid the recent price downturn.The rise in exchange flows presented that miners are currently selling their BTC, expecting the asset’s price to go down further. Miners liquidating could also be due to the net realized losses of the BTC network.The miner Netflow to exchanges also turned positive. When the metric turns positive, it signifies that more coins are being sent to exchanges than are to private or cold wallets. Miner Netflow turning positive would indicate that miners are bearish on the price and are under pressure to sell.Notably, bitcoin supply in loss (7d MA) reached a two-year high of 8,501,301.765 BTC, indicative of the network and holders in pain.While volatility and bearish spells are a constant in the market, BTC price has never fallen below the all-time high of the previous cycle. Over the last decade, BTC’s price has seen numerous bull cycles followed by a significant decline from the all-time highs.However, with BTC’s current price trading very close to its 2017 all-time high price of $19,783, any further sell-off from this point could push the cryptocurrency to the 2017 territory.Data from Santiment presented that traders were reacting to the major price drops this week, and the 4.5-year high in bitcoin’s daily token circulation indicates how polarized the market was.Around 497k unique BTC were moved to start the week, the highest amount since December 6, 2017.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireJapan runs biggest trade deficit in more than 8 years in MayStocks, bonds bounce after Fed lifts rates by 75 bpsBrazil police find remains in search for UK journalist, suspect confesses – investigatorsU.S. SEC seeks data from index providers over role in investment decisionsWorkers at Canadian National Railway threaten to strikeU.S.-led coalition says it detained senior ISIS leader in SyriaGenesis Trading Head of Marketing Insights Noelle Acheson joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss how the Fed will impact the crypto space, the crypto market sell-off, and how some companies are bouncing back.The Ethereum Merge has been planned for years, but that doesn’t mean it will be good for the price of ETH.The crypto hedge fund, which has been one of the industry’s most prolific investors in new protocols and is also a large borrower, is facing $400 million in liquidations on its positions; ether drops toward $1,000.Companies have been competing fiercely for skilled workers due to widespread labour shortages.

Since consolidation has been the active sentiment in the case of BAT, price did not swindle much.As a result, the altcoin only experienced a four-day-long crash. At the same time, other cryptocurrencies kept sinking for more than or about eight days.But the question is if it was an organic rally or not.The answer, although, is yes. Not only did the altcoin reach closer to its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), but it also drew significant inflows from investors, which was visible on the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF).This would help the altcoin in creating a sustainable rise, furthering its recovery.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireCosby accuser seek damages, his side says ‘game over’ in final argumentsN.Korea expands restoration at nuke test site to second tunnel -reportBank of England set to raise rates again as inflation heads for 10%New Zealand economy contracts as exports slumpTron (TRX) Bounces Back as Fears of a USDD Collapse EaseExclusive-FAA urges airlines to act as wireless carriers plan 5G signal boostBitcoin price dives to $20,000, Ethereum’s ether tested the $1,000 zone, and BNB is struggling to stay above the key $200 support.As Bitcoin fell below $21,000 today, it took most of the altcoins along with it leaving less than a dozen cryptos to lead the recovery.Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman breaks down top business headlines including Caterpillar moving to Irving, Texas, Warren Buffett donating $4 billion in Berkshire Hathaway stock, and Microsoft no longer supporting the Internet Explorer browser.After a week of announcements in NSW to improve the affordability of childcare and early learning, today Victorian parents are getting a turn.

This is your Friday morning wrap.","Cosmos and a few other alts were the only few to close in the green today.Ethereum partook in the active downtrend losing more than 11%Bitcoin followed a similar path and ended up trading at $20,855.The broader market was expected to correct the ongoing correction, but the king coin, Bitcoin, and other altcoins decided to go down another path. Consequently, over $50 billion was wiped out of the crypto market in 24 hours.ATOM was one of the only few cryptocurrencies that closed in green at the time of writing following days of red candles. The altcoin had already witnessed a price fall of 32.8% within the span of a week, which only further added to the 86.4% depreciation observed since the coin hit its all-time high of $44.51.Thus some recovery would instill confidence in ATOM holders. And recovery is on the charts since MACD was heading towards a bullish crossover at the time of writing, with green bars appearing on the indicator.Unlike ATOM, Maker DAO’s native token MKR continued its downtrend, losing more than 10% in a single day. This has brought the price down to $701 from the highs of $2,301 the altcoin was at less than two months ago.Since April, the cryptocurrency has not been able to flip the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the 100-day SMA into support, which has led to multiple dips. In 2 months, MKR has dipped by 57%, 29%, and 48.5% on separate occasions as both the SMAs acted as a resistance level for the coin.The Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) token marked another drop on the charts, 11.54% nonetheless, as the altcoin came down to trade at $3.23. The slight growth observed yesterday did not do much for the coin anyways, as APE is 43.4% below where it was a week ago.The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remained stuck in the bearish zone inching closer to the oversold zone, a slip into which might cause the coin to fall further.Surprisingly the DeFi protocol token managed to sustain a rise at the time of writing, climbing the charts by 10.08%. Trading at $3.44, CAKE still has a long way to go in order to recover the losses witnessed throughout the week as it declined by 31.36%.However, the coin is observing no support from the price indicators as to whether the rally could go on. The Parabolic SAR continued to suggest a downtrend, which could keep the price consolidated for a while even if it doesn’t reduce further.The Bitcoin hard fork is facing the wrath of the bears, similar to other cryptocurrencies, sinking by almost 12% today following the 40% plunge observed in the last eight days. Trading at $113.59 at the time of writing, BCH might continue its downtrend for a few more days.This is because bearishness has only increased instead of diminishing, according to the Awesome Oscillator.

There was a bearish reaction below the $21,500 support zone.The price declined nearly 10% and broke the $20,500 support. It traded close to the $20,000 level and settled below the 21 simple moving average (H1). The bulls are now attempting a fresh recovery wave above the $21,000 level.On the upside, the price is facing a major hurdle near the $21,650 level and the 21 simple moving average (H1). The next major resistance sits at $22,800. If there is no upside break, bitcoin could start a fresh decline and may possibly trade below $20,000.ETH also followed a bearish path below the $1,200 support zone. The price gained pace below the $1,100 level and the 21 simple moving average (H1).The bears even pushed the price below $1,050. It traded close to the $1,000 support zone and is currently attempting a recovery wave. It is facing a key bearish trend line with resistance near $1,130 on the hourly chart.A proper upside break above the $1,130 level and $1,150 could push the price towards the $1,200 resistance zone. If not, it could start another decline and may possibly trade below $1,020.BNB started a major decline from well above the $300 level. There was a clear move below the $280 and $250 support levels to move into a bearish zone.The price even settled below the $240 level and the 21-day simple moving average. The bulls are now taking a stand near a major support at $200. An immediate resistance is near the $230 level. The next key resistance might be $250, above which the bulls could aim a move towards the $280 level.A clear upside break above the $280 resistance might stage a strong rally. If there is no upside break, the price could start a fresh decline below the $200 level.The next major support is near $180 in the near term. Any more losses may possibly push BNB price towards the $150 support zone.Cardano (ADA) is showing a few bearish signs below the $0.50 level. The next major support is near $0.45, below which there is a risk of a move towards the $0.42 level.Polkadot (DOT) is struggling below the $8.00 resistance. If there is a downside break below the $7.00 support, the price could even test the $6.20 level.A few trending coins are LINK, ALGO, and ATOM.

ADA sits below the 50-day EMA after Monday’s bearish cross.On Monday, Cardano (ADA) fell by 5.37%. Following an 11.38% tumble on Sunday, ADA ended the day at $0.4637.A choppy session saw ADA slide through the First Major Support Level at $0.4658 and the Second Major Support Level at $0.4416 to a morning low of $0.4358.Finding late morning support, ADA struck a day high of $0.4978 before falling back to sub-$0.47.The First Major Support Level at $0.4658 limited the downside late in the day.Market conditions improved this morning, however, with ADA finding strong support. Amidst the bearish sentiment that has plagued the broader crypto market, investor sentiment towards the June 29 Vasil hard fork remains the key near term.Dip buyers appear to have chosen ADA over bitcoin (BTC) and other altcoins, including Binance Coin (BNB), with investors looking ahead to the June 29 Vasil hard fork.Investor sentiment towards Cardano and network upgrades had been bullish, delivering strong support ahead of the latest broad-based crypto sell-off.Notably, BTC and others fell to new 2022 lows this week, while ADA steered clear of its May 12 low of $0.3919.Anticipation of the Vasil hard fork, scheduled on June 29, continued to attract sidelined investors.Scaling remains an issue for the crypto majors. For Cardano, the hard fork will implement features such as pipelining, which can lead to better scaling.The other positive driver includes Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs). These are new features to improve the network.At the time of writing, ADA was up 7.61% to $0.4990.A mixed start to the day saw ADA fall to an early morning low of $0.4358 before striking a high of $0.5191.ADA broke through the First Major Resistance Level at $0.4957 before easing back to sub-$0.50.The First Major Support Level delivered late morning support.ADA will need to hold above the First Major Resistance Level and avoid the $0.4658 pivot to retarget the Second Major Resistance Level at $0.5277.ADA would need broader crypto market support to breakout from the morning high of $0.5191.In the event of an extended rally, resistance at $0.55 would likely come into play before any pullback. The Third Major Resistance Level sits at $0.5898.A fall through the First Major Resistance Level and the $0.4658 pivot would bring the First Major Support Level at $0.4339 into play.Barring an extended sell-off throughout the day, ADA should avoid sub-$0.43. The Second Major Support Level sits at $0.4037.The EMAs and the 4-hourly candlestick chart (below) send a bearish signal. At the time of writing, ADA sits below the 50-day EMA, currently at $0.5474. This morning, the 50-day EMA pulled back from the 100-day EMA. The 100-day EMA fell back from the 200-day EMA; price negative.A move through to $0.55 levels would support a run at the 100-day EMA, currently at $0.56.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMeta wins appeal against block of Giphy deal by UK regulatorRussia’s Wildberries selling Zara clothes online despite Inditex halting operationsBiden to meet with Saudi crown prince despite human rights criticismCountries mull delaying new EU carbon market in search of climate dealColruyt’s annual profit falls as inflation, tough competition take tollEuropean stocks post six straight days of lossesThe total value of Australia's property market is now five times bigger than Australia’s GDP.

This furthered the already declining crypto market cap and brought it below the $1 trillion mark as the market lost more than $280 billion in the span of 72 hours.The tenth biggest cryptocurrency fell victim to the bears after the broader market crash took it down along with other altcoins. In the last four days, the meme coin leader has plunged by 30.4%, making this the third biggest crash this year. DOGE’s trading price depreciated from $0.079 on June 10 to $0.055 at the time of writing.The coin is further set to fall as the Bollinger Bands divergence evinces that the volatility is about to intensify further, making DOGE vulnerable to price swings. However, since the candlesticks are below the bias, the volatility is most likely going to be bearish, which could result in a downtrend.This is further backed by the bearish crossover that took place yesterday. Less than two weeks ago, DOGE experienced a bullish crossover through which investors were expecting a recovery. But now that it’s invalidated, the price might drop further, potentially even below $0.05.While Dogecoin did not have much going on development-wise, Ethereum just witnessed one of the biggest and most anticipated events in its history. The deployment of The Merge upgrade on Ethereum’s Ropsten test network occurred less than a week ago. However, the arrival of Proof of Stake on the network was expected to draw much more bullishness from the investors, which was not the case.In fact, even before today’s crash, ETH wasn’t treading any better as the price was consistently declining to bring ETH down from $1,953 to $1,788.The crash extended this bearishness, and in 4 days, ETH plummeted from $1,788 to trade at $1,244 at the time of writing, marking a 30.72% loss.The recovering Relative Strength Index (RSI) was also invalidated, and the altcoin king fell back down right at the edge of the oversold zone.Thus, just like the rest of the market, recovery from this point will not only be challenging but also delayed.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireTrump aides tell Jan. 6 committee he ignored their doubts about election fraudRussian forces cut off last routes out of eastern Ukraine cityS&P 500 confirms bear market as recession worry growsBritain’s LGIM votes against fewer companies for climate failuresExclusive-Disney/Pixar’s ‘Lightyear,’ with same-sex couple, will not play in 14 countries; China in questionCzech central banker Benda: 50, even 75 bps hike may not be enough this month – paper(Bloomberg) -- Crypto companies that have been trying to go public since last year’s boom remain stuck in a lengthy back-and-forth with US regulators, adding to the pile of challenges facing the industry.Most Read from BloombergChina Says It May Have Detected Signals From Alien CivilizationsStocks Jump as Powell Soothes Wall Street’s Nerves: Markets WrapFed Hikes 75 Basis Points; Powell Says 75 or 50 Likely in JulyWorld’s Central Banks Got It Wrong, and Economies Pay the PriceAmericans Are BuildThe crash has now wiped over £300 billion from the combined value of crypto assetsCrypto market capitalization increased some 4.5% in the past 24 hours after sliding under $1 trillion earlier this week.The Australian Taxation Office is cracking down on these rule-breakers and providing helpful tips to avoid getting caught out.

XRP sits below the 50-day EMA.On Sunday, XRP fell by 4.51%. Following a 5.75% slide on Saturday, XRP ended the week down by 13.2% to $0.3430.Market sentiment towards US inflation and Fed monetary policy overshadowed news updates from the ongoing SEC v Ripple case.Amidst the market reaction to US inflation figures on Friday, minor court rulings had a muted impact on XRP. This was despite the SEC having faced some tough questions at Tuesday’s court-scheduled SEC-Ripple conference.This week could be a defining moment in the SEC v Ripple case. A court ruling in favor of Ripple Lab may force the SEC into a settlement.On Tuesday, June 7, the SEC and Ripple attended a court-scheduled conference. Judge Sarah Netburn scheduled the conference, open to the public, to focus on the SEC’s claims that all documents relating to William Hinman’s 2018 speech should fall under the attorney-client privilege.In 2018, the former SEC Director of the Division of Corporation Finance said that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are not securities.Following at least six SEC motions to shield the Hinman speech-related documents, the court ruling could decide the outcome of the case.A ruling in favor of Ripple Lab may force the SEC into an early settlement. The SEC’s attempts to shield the documents raised speculation that the content could be materially damaging to the SEC case. This consensus has fueled the speculation that the SEC would settle in the event of an unfavorable ruling.There is no scheduled ruling date, meaning the courts could rule at any time. While the crypto winter has sent XRP back to sub-$0.31, a finding in favor of Ripple Lab should prove material for XRP.At the time of writing, XRP was down 9.27% to $0.3112.A mixed morning saw XRP rise to an early morning high of $0.35 before hitting reverse.Falling well short of the First Major Resistance Level at $0.3588, XRP tumbled to a morning low of $0.3034.The reversal saw XRP fall through the First Major Support Level at $0.3333 and the Second Major Support Level at $0.3236.Falling to a new current year low, it was also a first visit to sub-$0.31 since January 2021, which coincided with investor reaction to the SEC lawsuit against Ripple Lab.XRP will need to move through the Major Support Levels and the $0.3491 pivot to target the First Major Resistance Level at $0.3588. XRP would need the broader crypto market support to return to $0.35 levels.In a broad-based crypto rebound, XRP should test resistance at $0.3650. The Second Major Resistance Level sits at $0.3745.Failure to move through Major Support Levels and the pivot would bring sub-$0.31 levels into play. Barring an extended sell-off throughout the afternoon, however, XRP should avoid the Third Major Support Level at $0.2981.The EMAs and the 4-hourly candlestick chart (below) send a bearish signal. At the time of writing, XRP sits below the 50-day EMA, currently at $0.3758. Today, the 50-day EMA fell back from the 100-day EMA. The 100-day EMA eased back from the 200-day EMA, XRP price negative.A return to $0.35 levels would support a run at the 50-day EMA. This week, the SEC v Ripple court ruling on the Hinman docs, the Fed monetary policy decision, and forward guidance will be the key drivers.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireGoogle, Facebook, Twitter will have to tackle deepfakes or risk EU fines – sourcesBritish police charge Kevin Spacey over alleged sex crimesHow high?

Market favorites Chainlink (LINK) and Cardano (ADA) saw particularly heavy losses despite favorable network news updates.The bearish Sunday session saw the total crypto market cap slide by $71 billion to a current-year low of $1,048 billion before steadying.By the day’s end, $64 billion came off the table. The sixth daily loss left the market cap down by $159 billion for the week.With the market focus now firmly on the Fed, heavier losses could be on the cards should the Fed interest rate projections shift higher.Another curveball for the crypto market is the likely change in the regulatory landscape. The collapse of TerraUSD Classic (USTC) and Terra LUNA expedited efforts to implement more stringent regulatory measures to protect retail investors.From the top ten cryptos, ADA led the way down, sliding by 11.39%, with DOGE (-9.11%) and SOL (-9.85%) close behind.Things were no better for the rest of the largest cryptos by market cap.BNB (-5.53%), BTC (-6.35%),  ETH (-6.39%), and XRP (-4.55%).The effect of the crypto winter is evident in the crypto rankings.

But Logan said that “he put it all in crypto” and, given the cryptocurrency markets decline from its 2021 highs, Jake’s investments are likely trading well in the red.Jake is not the only social media star to have lost money in crypto. Logan Paul admitted on his podcast in May that he had lost more than $500,000 by investing in the ill-fated Luna token, while fellow YouTube star KSI had lost about $3 million in the same investment.Jake has also been under scrutiny in 2022 for shilling a number of Non-Fungible Token (NFT) and crypto rug pulls, where projects make big promises to would-be investors, take their money, then fail to deliver. Perhaps this is a sign that, with his crypto investments sitting so far underwater, Jake is feeling the pinch and looking for alternate sources of income.Pseudo-anonymous crypto sleuth Coffeezilla has reportedly been able to connect Paul to crypto promotions and projects totaling $2.2 million.While Paul has made substantial sums by promoting often doomed crypto projects, there is every chance that he sunk some portion of his fortune into these schemes, not realizing the scam at hand. In that sense, his losses could be ugly.But Jake is known to have been a long-time fan of what has so far proven to be crypto’s safest bet, Bitcoin. He has in the past claimed that he invested his entire earnings from his first Vine brand deal in the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization back when he was sixteen and it was trading around $100 per token.Though, as of Sunday, BTC/USD is trading nearly 60% lower versus its November 2021 highs at $69,000, Paul would still be up around 280x on this investment.Bitcoin’s struggles in the near-term look for from over, as global economic conditions worsen and persistently high inflation forces major central banks like the US Federal Reserve to press ahead with monetary tightening regardless.But Bitcoin’s long-term outlook looks very promising, with the global adoption of cryptocurrency payments/investing still looking to be very much in its early stage, and as narratives of bitcoin being a long-term store of value akin to gold and a nascent form of “freedom money” gain popularity.If Jake Paul put any substantial portion of his $40 million in earnings in 2021 into Bitcoin, he will probably be sitting on a tidy profit by the end of this decade, with many forecasting the cryptocurrency moving into the hundreds of thousands per token, if not hitting one million.Paul has also in the past praised Dogecoin as “Bitcoin’s younger brother”. The outlook for the crypto community’s favorite meme-coin is far less certain than with proven crypto safe-haven bitcoin. Indeed, DOGE/USD is currently around 90% lower versus its 2021 highs.But as the likes of Elon Musk continues to tout Dogecoin as a feasible currency, you never know. If Paul put any sizeable portion of his 2021 earnings into the dog-inspired coin and Musk makes it official tender any future SpaceX colony on Mars, you never know!This article was originally posted on FX EmpireJapan game giant Nexon plots western expansionAUD/USD Forex Technical Analysis – Testing Short-Term Retracement Zone at .7056 to .7002Gun reform deal forged by U.S. senators, with key Republican backingTrump campaign manager, former state officials to headline Jan. 6 panel’s ‘Big Lie’ hearingTasty name but no Big Mac: Russia opens rebranded McDonald’s restaurantsNetflix announces another round of global hit ‘Squid Game’After a week of announcements in NSW to improve the affordability of childcare and early learning, today Victorian parents are getting a turn.

Market reaction to US inflation figures weighed.This morning, however, XRP found early support, with investors now awaiting the Court ruling on the Hinman speech-related documents.Key technical indicators remain bearish. XRP sits below the 50-day EMA.On Friday, XRP slid by 4.65%. Following a 0.10% decline on Thursday, XRP ended the day at $0.3811. News updates from the ongoing SEC v Ripple case took a backseat, with investors responding to US inflation figures for May.A bullish start saw XRP strike a day high of $0.4112 before hitting reverse.XRP broke through the First Major Resistance Level at $0.4033 and the Second Major Resistance Level at $0.4070.Market reaction to US inflation figures, however, led XRP to a day low of $0.3761.The extended sell-off saw XRP fall through the day’s Major Support Levels to visit sub-$0.38 for the first time in June.Market angst over inflation had tested support ahead of Friday’s US inflation numbers, overshadowing news updates from the ongoing SEC v Ripple case.Going into the weekend, some minor court filings provided little distraction. Things could prove to be materially different next week, however.Last Tuesday, the SEC and Ripple attended a court-scheduled conference. The subject matter was the SEC’s position on William Hinman’s 2018 speech-related documents.The conference leaned in favor of the defense, with Judge Sarah Netburn grilling the SEC’s shifts in position vis-à-vis William Hinman’s famous speech. In 2018, the former SEC Director of the Division of Corporation Finance stated that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are not securities.Since August 2021, the SEC has filed at least six motions, claiming that Hinman’s speech falls under the attorney-client privilege. At one point, the SEC had taken the view that Hinman’s comments were his own.The consensus is that the speech-related documents contain material damaging to the SEC case. A ruling in favor of Ripple could expedite a settlement and drive XRP back towards $1.00.At the time of writing, XRP was up 0.34% to $0.3824.A bullish start to the day saw XRP rise to a morning high of $0.3881 before sliding to a low of $0.3797.XRP left the Major Support and Resistance Levels untested through the morning session.XRP will need to move through the $0.3895 pivot to target the First Major Resistance Level at $0.4028. XRP would need the broader crypto market support to return to $0.40 levels.In a broad-based crypto rally, XRP should test the Second Major Resistance Level at $0.4246 and resistance at $0.4250.

On the other hand, the adoption forecast beyond 10% is forecasted using the average/weighted average of the past adoption curves.Using the Cumulative Sum of Net Entities Growth and its CAGR of 60%, the report forecasted that global bitcoin adoption would break past 10% in the year 2030. The red line in the chart below represents actual bitcoin adoption, and the green lines represent forecasted bitcoin adoption.That said, a recent FXEmpire article pointed out how cryptocurrency payments are still on US customers’ list as retailers try to fast forward growth in the sector. The crucial question, however, still remains whether BTC adoption would propel price growth.As more and more people on board the bitcoin train and increase adoption of the technology, the value is bound to rise. While it is generally considered that rise in adoption pushes price rise too, the same can’t be used as a scientific short-term trading tool.Instead, it is essential to remember a quote by the British statistician George Box – “all models are wrong, but some models are useful.” Much like other prediction models, the report released by Blockware also serves as a conceptual guide for long-term Bitcoin investors.At press time, BTC was trading for the price of $29,079, noting a 3.81% decrease over the last day. BTC’s tussle with the $30,000 price range has been going on since May 10.Interestingly, FXEmpire earlier reported how macro indicators like the MVRV ratio presented a strengthening narrative of BTC as Digital Gold.Last year, blockchain data platform Chainalysis revealed that global adoption of BTC and cryptocurrency surged 881% from July 2020 to June 2021. Notably, Vietnam had the highest cryptocurrency adoption at that time, followed by India and Pakistan.Thus, as the adoption of BTC increases, the price can also see decent long-term growth.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireRussian-held Ukraine region scheming to sell grain to North America – RIAU.S. SEC investigating Goldman Sachs over ESG funds – WSJUkraine pleads for more weapons, cholera spreads in MariupolN.Korea appoints Choe Son Hui as new foreign minister -KCNAUkraine and Russia: What you need to know right nowBrazil police find apparent human remains in river where reporter vanishedThe S&P; 500 has rallied to snap a five-session losing skid after a policy announcement by the Federal Reserve that raised interest rates to market expectations as the US central bank seeks to fight rising inflation without sparking a recession.The Federal Reserve raised its target interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point - its biggest rate hike since 1994 - and projected a slowing economy and rising unemployment in the months to come.The total value of Australia's property market is now five times bigger than Australia’s GDP.

Here’s how far it expects the market to drop.","The Crypto market plunged by 4%, led by multiple altcoins.Bitcoin and Ethereum followed the lead and slipped by almost 4%.Less than 10 of the top 100 cryptocurrencies posted green candles.After the leaked Cryptocurrency regulation bill came to light, suggesting stringent measures to regulate cryptocurrencies, the market reacted pessimistically as expected. Altcoins, including Chainlink, Cardano, Algorand, and more, lost more than 8% at the time of writing.The altcoin had a rather unfortunate day as it traded 11.27% below the trading price it was at 24 hours ago. ALGO has been in a continued downtrend for the entire month, and as a result, the price has dropped from $0.74 to $0.36 at the time of writing.Despite the inflows observed over the last week, ALGO also noted the highest amount of outflow ever recorded on the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF). Thus, ALGO might continue slipping on the charts unless the broader market recovers.The native token of the biggest NFT collection Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), has been falling on the charts since it hit its all-time high back in April. Over this week alone, ApeCoin has plunged by almost 19%, with 10% added in the last 24 hours.However, it seems like a trend reversal is in the books for the altcoin as bearishness on the Awesome Oscillator has been reducing since the month began. Once bullishness arrives, APE could also rise above its current trading price of $5.2.The third-gen cryptocurrency was performing well enough for the last couple of days, rising by 40.47% as anticipation ahead of the Vasil hard fork built up. However, impacted by the broader market bearishness, ADA slipped by 9.3% in the last 24 hours.The Relative Strength Index (RSI), which managed to recover into the bullish-neutral zone, returned to the neutral point as Cardano fell.The DeFi token, which was on the road to recovery after the crash of May, lost its path in the last ten days when the altcoin declined by 25.93%, pushed further by today’s 9.78% dip. AAVE is now once again looking to regain $100 as a support level which might be difficult.According to the MACD indicator, the bullish crossover that gained strength around mid-May is about to be invalidated with a bearish crossover which might result in the coin slipping below $87, its current trading price.Unlike other altcoins, AVAX has stayed true to its current nature, continuing the downtrend that began two months ago back in April. Since then, the asset has lost 78.26% of its value, in addition to the 7.68% decline witnessed in the last 24 hours.The Parabolic SAR’s white dots, which have been evincing the downtrend, remain stationary at the time of writing, which means AVAX is set to decline further.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireBritain, U.N. official condemn Donbas death sentences against British soldiersUSD/CAD Exchange Rate Prediction – The Dollar Surged on Higher Treasury YieldsU.S. SEC investigating Goldman Sachs over ESG funds – WSJTexas judge suspends governor’s order to investigate transgender proceduresN.Korea appoints Choe Son Hui as new foreign minister -KCNABiden unveils migration plan at Americas summit roiled by divisionThe S&P; 500 has rallied to snap a five-session losing skid after a policy announcement by the Federal Reserve that raised interest rates to market expectations as the US central bank seeks to fight rising inflation without sparking a recession.The Federal Reserve raised its target interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point - its biggest rate hike since 1994 - and projected a slowing economy and rising unemployment in the months to come.The total value of Australia's property market is now five times bigger than Australia’s GDP.

Here’s how far it expects the market to drop.","Gary Gensler and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continue to target the crypto market despite jurisdictional uncertainty.This week, the Lummis and Gillibrand bill filing aimed to give the CFTC the upper hand in regulating the crypto market.On Thursday, CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger said that crypto developers and US lawmakers are pushing for CFTC control.The Securities and Exchange Commission has been particularly vocal about the digital currency space, with several platforms paying hefty fines.Regulatory uncertainty has lingered despite the SEC’s successes in out-of-court settlements.Until now, the Howey Test remains the fallback for the SEC to claim jurisdiction on digital assets, including XRP.Such has been the uncertainty that even the SEC’s case against Ripple Lab has been ongoing since December 2020.This week, however, there is the possibility of digital currencies falling under the watchful eye of the CFTC.Overnight, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioner Summer Mersinger reportedly said that US lawmakers and crypto developers were looking to place the authority to regulate digital assets with the CFTC.Currently, the CFTC regulates the crypto futures, which are limited to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) futures.Regulatory chatter has picked up, with both the SEC and the CFTC laying claim to the digital asset space.This week, however, lawmakers took a step forward in placing digital currencies under the CFTC.Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand filed a bipartisan bill titled ‘The Responsible Financial Innovation Act.’For investors and innovators, clarity on whether cryptos fall under the classification of a security or a commodity would remove a significant amount of regulatory uncertainty. Investors and developers will, therefore, be watching the progress on Capitol Hill.SEC Chair Gary Gensler may not give in too easily in allowing the CFTC to oversee the digital asset space.In May, SEC Chair Gary Gensler talked of the need for comprehensive rules for digital assets.Speaking at the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Annual Meeting, Gensler stated that most cryptocurrencies are securities.Gensler reportedly said,“Most crypto tokens involve a group of entrepreneurs raising money from the public in anticipation of profits – the hallmark of an investment contract or a security under our jurisdiction. Most crypto tokens are investment contracts under the Supreme Court’s Howey Test.”This year, via letter, lawmakers questioned the SEC’s targeted approach towards crypto firms and raised concerns over how the SEC approach could impact innovation. As with The Responsible Financial Innovation Act, the letter was bipartisan. Members from both sides of the Aisle co-signed the letter.With the CFTC and the SEC looking to regulate the digital asset space, it will likely boil down to the final version and passage of The Responsible Financial Innovation Act.We can certainly expect some political wrangling in the corridors of power. Both regulators may consider the oversight of the digital asset space as the golden egg.The crypto market will reflect its preference in the months ahead, with price action to closely reflect the bill’s passage.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireUkraine say Russia looks for weak points in Ukrainian defences near key riverHistory of Japan’s intervention in currency marketsChina’s May new bank loans surge 1.89 trln yuan, much stronger than forecastsRussian central bank to study legality of banks’ plans for fees on FX accountsAustralia’s longest-running soap Neighbours calls it a wrapShanghai to lock down millions again for mass COVID testingThe S&P; 500 has rallied to snap a five-session losing skid after a policy announcement by the Federal Reserve that raised interest rates to market expectations as the US central bank seeks to fight rising inflation without sparking a recession.The Federal Reserve raised its target interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point - its biggest rate hike since 1994 - and projected a slowing economy and rising unemployment in the months to come.While variable rates are currently being lifted, fixed-rate holders have been warned they are not immune to interest rate hikes.

But while the king rested, most of its subjects took matters into their own hands, and as a result, the crypto market was saved from another red candle.Despite noting no significant rise in price action since the end of the May crash, MATIC has been stuck in a sideways momentum for a month now. All the rises are corrected over the next few days, and the cycle continues.Even after marking a 7.52% rise today, MATIC might remain rangebound at $0.64 since the Bollinger Bands indicate no major price swings coming anytime soon.Tezos was one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies of the day as the altcoin has been in a sustained incline over the last month. Up by 32% since May 11, the altcoin was trading at $2.21 at the time of writing, receiving a 16.3% push just this week.The rise also effectively pulled XTZ out of the bearish zone that the coin has been stuck in since April, as visible on the Relative Strength Index (RSI).Closing in green consistently throughout the week, LINK has inched closer to breaching the $10 mark and closing above it. Up by 8.36% in the last 24 hours, the altcoin might also sustain this rally since the crypto is receiving consistent support from the community.The Chaikin Money Flow indicates that the growth is also organic since money has been flowing into the asset.Solana is in an interesting bind as following Ethereum’s footsteps, the altcoin has declined by more than 9% since the crash occurred. Solana’s crash has been one of the most disappointing ones since, in less than nine months, SOL went from trading above $200 to trading at $40.5 at the time of writing.This is despite the fact that the MACD has been consistently indicating a bullish crossover on the charts.Among the top cryptocurrencies of the week, the relatively lesser-known cryptocurrency Helium has been on an uptrend for the last ten days, rising from the lows of $6.89 to $11.97 at press time.The altcoin is also one of the few to observe sustained growth and will continue to do so, as evinced by the Parabolic SAR’s active uptrend.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireHedge-fund Founder Einhorn Says the Fed Can’t Control InflationShanghai faces unexpected round of COVID testing for most residentsFederal prosecutors open criminal inquiry of Wells Fargo’s hiring practices – NYTYellen says U.S. recession unlikely, but no drop in gasoline prices soonU.S. House to weigh more Supreme Court security next week, Pelosi saysAir New Zealand raises annual earnings forecast on improved demandCompanies have been competing fiercely for skilled workers due to widespread labour shortages.
