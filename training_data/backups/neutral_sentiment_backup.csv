It was one of the most famous search engines, and by 1996, it was Javascript-enabled.New feature development for Internet Explorer was discontinued in 2016 in favor of the new browser Microsoft Edge, which comes with in-built Internet Explorer mode, so that users can access the legacy IE-based websites and applications.To help users with the transition, Internet Explorer will progressively redirect users to the new Edge browser through the Reload in IE mode button on the toolbar to open the webpage in the new browser. This applies to Windows 10 users and includes every edition of the OS – Home, Pro, Enterprise, Education, and IoT.Microsoft Corporation price-consensus-chart | Microsoft Corporation QuoteThe launch of Alphabet’s GOOGL Google Chrome in 2008 marked the official beginning of the end for Internet Explorer as the shiny new cross-platform browser grew to dominate the market.The usage of Internet Explorer has plummeted in recent years. Internet Explorer has less than 0.5% of the overall browser market share, per StatCounter report. Currently, Google’s Chrome is the leading web browser with 65% share of the market, followed by Apple’s AAPL Safari at 19%. Microsoft Edge currently has about 4% share, followed by Mozilla’s Firefox.A month ago, Apple announced that it was ending the production of the iPhone's predecessor–iPod. Two decades after the device's debut in 2001, iPod Touch is the only model available today.Microsoft has labeled Internet Explorer as a compatibility solution rather than a browser that businesses should actively be using. Microsoft 365 ended support for Internet Explorer on Aug 17, 2021, and Microsoft Teams ended support for IE on Nov 30, 2020.Nikkei reported this week that some government agencies and financial institutions in Japan have been slow to respond to the IE retirement. The website for Japan Pension Service must still be viewed in Edge’s IE mode, for example.While Microsoft has moved to its Chromium-powered Edge as the default browser on Windows 11, the MSHTML engine that powers Internet Explorer is still part of Windows 11.

It expects to report between $51.94 billion and $52.74 billion in revenues for the quarter. The company had previously forecast fourth-quarter revenues in the range of $52.4 billion to $53.2 billion. Microsoft also slightly cut its quarterly earnings forecast, saying it now expects to report adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.24 to $2.32. Previously, the company had projected adjusted EPS between $2.28 and $2.35.Nonetheless, Azure’s increased availability in more than 60 announced regions worldwide is anticipated to have bolstered its cloud business and strengthened its competitive position against Amazon’s AMZN Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud.In the last-reported quarter, Amazon’s AWS revenues (16% of sales) rose 37% year over year to $18.4 billion.

Yet even if the billionaire, who plans to address Twitter employees Thursday, decides to walk away from the deal, the electric-vehicle maker’s shares face enough headwinds that they may not recover that lost value.Blame it on rapidly worsening investor sentiment, with US stocks entering a bear market because of soaring inflation and higher interest rates that threaten to trigger a recession. Technology and growth companies -- whose valuations reflect expectations for big future profits -- have seen the worst of the rout, and Tesla fits that description to a tee.“While there might be some short-term relief for Tesla if Musk walks away, if the wider stock market keeps on plummeting I do not think Tesla is going to be immune to further slides,” said David Jones, chief market strategist at Capital.com.Tesla shares are now down 39% since Musk first disclosed a stake in Twitter, while the the S&P 500 Index has fallen 19% over the same period.The stock initially fell as Tesla shareholders fretted that Musk would be spread too thin if he tried to overhaul Twitter while also running Tesla and overseeing his Space Exploration Technologies Corp. He also planned to use some of his Tesla stock as collateral for loans to pay for the deal, though his latest financing doesn’t include share pledges.The broader economic anxiety has taken the shine off of good news, while negative headlines have served to deepen the gloom. For instance, when Tesla announced a widely anticipated stock split Friday, its shares didn’t get a boost. In contrast, a similar move by the company in 2020 had led to a 60% jump in the share price from the day of the announcement to the execution date, and partly fueled a stratospheric rally.Then there are other troubles that the company faces, including climbing raw-material costs, supply-chain shortages and production disruptions in China that refuse to go away. All of which present big hurdles to any rebound rally.Also, it’s hard to think of any outcome of the Twitter situation that can be good for Tesla investors, market watchers said. A takeover of Twitter by Musk will revive worries that he’s spreading himself too thin, while a decision to quit the deal won’t be much cleaner either.“There are valid reasons to believe that any deal termination would come only after lengthy and difficult negotiations and/or litigation,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “Neither is a great use of Musk’s time and energy.”Musk has publicly expressed reluctance about the acquisition, saying last month it was “temporarily on hold.” Still, the deal has continued to progress in the background, with Twitter executives telling staff they plan to enforce the deal agreement.Given Musk’s penchant for surprising investors, anything is possible, according to Sosnick.“Sure, he could pull a rabbit out of his hat tomorrow or at some point in the future; he has done it before,” he said. “But the market doesn’t expect it right now.”Tesla shares dropped as much as 6.1% on Thursday in New York.Tech Chart of the DayWhat a turnabout: Electric-vehicle startups Rivian Automotive Inc. and Lucid Group Inc., which surpassed Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. in market value late last year, have plummeted in 2022, diving 74% and 57% respectively.

Every week, Tracey will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life. To listen to the podcast, click here:  https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1939483/the-secret-weapon-of-long-term-stock-investorsWelcome to Episode #318 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.(1:00) - The Power of Dollar Cost Averaging: Should You Keep Buying?(9:30) - Finding Strong Stocks For The  Long Term Investment(21:15) - Episode Roundup: MSFT, SHOP, ETSY, MPC, SIG, TTE Podcast@Zacks.comEvery week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.This week, Tracey is going solo to talk about the secret weapon that long-term stock investors can deploy during a stock market sell-off: dollar cost averaging.Dollar cost averaging is when an investor invests the same amount of money on a set schedule, maybe once a week or once a month, regardless of if the stock market is higher or lower at that time.There are really two ways investors can dollar cost average.1.       Buying the indexes such as the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ2.       Buying individual stocksTracey believes that one works better than the other.As she has talked about in prior podcasts, in 2000 and 2001, after the stock market had already started to sell off in the dot-com bust, Tracey started dollar cost averaging in Microsoft (MSFT).Microsoft was one of the 4 tech titan stocks of the 1990s which was one of the big stock winners of that decade. Many Microsoft employees became millionaires from their stock options.As it started to sell-off in 2000, Microsoft suddenly seemed on sale. But it was a fake out. Even though Tracey dollar cost averaged for several years, she ultimately got out of the stock by 2005-2006.Microsoft's stock didn't hit the 2000 highs again until 2013.Shopify (SHOP) was one of the investor favorites of the pandemic, with shares soaring to new all-time highs. At one point, over the last 5 years, Shopify shares were up over 1750%.But they've fallen 75% in the last year and are now up just 249% during the last 5-years. That's still beating the NASDAQ's 5-year return of 76% but the outsized gains have been wiped out in 2022.For some investors, it seems like Shopify shares are on sale after the big slide. But are they?Shopify still trades with a forward P/E of 102.Is Shopify a value trap like Microsoft was in 2001?If you're going to dollar cost average individual stocks, look in a new direction. What worked the last 5 years might not work the next 5.Use the Zacks Rank to find stocks with rising earnings estimates and look for those with cheap P/E and P/S ratios.1.       Marathon Petroleum (MPC) Marathon Petroleum is a refiner. Shares are up 63% year-to-date so some investors will be reluctant to jump in ""at the top."" That's why dollar cost averaging is so effective. It takes away the fear of buying on the highs because it happens automatically.Marathon Petroleum is very cheap with a forward P/E of just 7.5 and a P/S ratio of 0.4. It also pays a dividend, currently yielding 2.3%.Marathon Petroleum is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Should you be jumping into Marathon Petroleum?2.       Signet Jewelers (SIG) Signet Jewelers is the beneficiary of the 2022 wedding craze. The company operates Kay, Zales and Jared retail stores and sells on line. This is a record year for weddings as couples who put it off during the first two years of the pandemic are diving in now. That means more jewelry sales.Signet's revenue is expected to rise another 5% this year and the earnings estimates are on the rise.After beating in the fiscal first quarter 2023, the analysts have been raising their full year estimates. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has jumped to $12.47 from $9.82 just 90 days ago.But Wall Street is worried about consumer spending as inflationary pressures hit. Shares are down 31% year-to-date.Signet is dirt cheap with a forward P/E of just 4.7 and a P/S ratio of 0.4. It also pays a dividend yielding 1.4%.Is it a good strategy to dollar cost average into some of the retailers like Signet Jewelers this year?3.       TotalEnergies (TTE) TotalEnergies is a large French integrated oil and gas company. With oil and natural gas prices at multi-year highs, TotalEnergies is expected to see soaring earnings in 2022.The 2022 Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for $11.81 which is earnings growth of 76.8% compared to last year when it earned $6.68.TotalEnergies pays a dividend, currently yielding 5%.It's also dirt cheap, with a forward P/E of 4.7 and a P/S ratio of 0.6.TotalEnergies shares are up just 13.5% in 2022.Is TotalEnergies a hidden gem?Tune into this week's podcast to find out.[In full disclosure, Tracey once again owns MSFT in her personal portfolio. She bought shares again in 2019. No, she is not currently dollar cost averaging into it.]Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

Viva Sales also uses artificial intelligence tools to scan calls and interactions with clients, analyzing customer sentiment to see what actions and marketing material are working well, and provide feedback to the sales representative.Viva Sales is free for those who already use Microsoft’s Dynamics customer relations software. Pricing for Salesforce customers will be detailed later this year when the software is generally available, Microsoft said Thursday.The new product offers the Redmond, Washington-based company a shot at capturing some revenue from users of Salesforce’s market-leading customer management software, which Microsoft has been trying to catch for nearly two decades. When Microsoft tries to win over Salesforce clients, some say they are interested in these kinds of features, but aren’t planning to rip out the customer relations software they already have, Judson Althoff, Microsoft’s chief commercial officer, said in an interview. Salesforce is also adding artificial intelligence capabilities to its programs and last year acquired business chat app Slack to integrate with its offerings.“Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose,” Althoff said. “If they choose to stay with Salesforce, they can still purchase Viva Sales separately and get all of the advancements that we’re bringing to bear, as well as the full integration with Teams and Office that customers have been asking for a long time. We do think this will be a big incremental revenue driver for us.”The program lets sales reps mark certain contacts as customers in their Outlook contact list, which will enable interactions to be synced with their customer-management program. Viva Sales connects with calendars, sees when customer meetings are coming up and shows the user which of their other contacts or LinkedIn connections are related to the customer. During a meeting held on Teams a sales rep can view all of the data related to the customer.AI researchers have expressed concern about accuracy and bias issues in various sentiment analysis algorithms and a product with those issues could raise concerns if the analysis is used to determine decisions on compensation or influences performance reviews. Althoff said Viva Sales enables the analysis it provides sales reps to be reviewed for accuracy. It also lets users grade recommendations and learns from the scores.Microsoft has been using the product with its sales teams for a year and has trained the AI, reducing some early issues, Althoff said. That means external customers won’t have to redo much of that work, he said.“In our early experimentation days, we would get some pretty crazy recommendations in terms of the next best action,” he said. But “the system learns wicked fast and within a very short period of time, we were getting pretty astute recommendations.”While initially Viva Sales will work automatically with Dynamics and Salesforce, the program includes the ability to manually connect data to other programs, Althoff said.Microsoft hopes the tools help eliminate much of the manual data entry and searching for information currently done by sales reps.“Companies are really trying hard to thread the needle on employee productivity and well-being at the same time, and we feel like this is a capability that actually helps make salespeople’s lives more effective, more efficient and more enjoyable,” he said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekEthereum Mining Is Going Away, and Miners Are Not HappyEmmanuel Macron Wants to Pay Workers a DividendHell Is a Cruise Ship at the Beginning of the PandemicAdults Who Love Toys?

2,2,"The Responsible Financial Innovation Act aims to give digital asset oversight powers to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).While the crypto market views such an outcome as crypto market-friendly, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has other ideas.On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Gensler is dissatisfied with lawmaker plans.Regulatory chatter continues to grab the crypto headlines in what has become a busy year for lawmakers and regulators. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has not been far from the headlines, with the SEC eyeing the task of regulating the digital asset space.Last week, we reported on a likely battle between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over the appointment to regulate digital currencies.The report was in response to a bipartisan bill beginning its passage on Capitol Hill, which looks to give the CFTC the coveted job of overseeing the digital asset space.On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported SEC Chair Gary Gensler raised concern over lawmaker legislation that “could compromise regulations that govern the broader capital markets.”Gensler held back from commenting directly on the bipartisan Lummis and Gillibrand bill.The SEC Chair did say,“We don’t want to undermine the protections we have in a $100 trillion capital market.”Adding,“Like behaviors should have like treatment.”Last week, US senators Cynthia Lummis and Republican Kirsten Gillibrand filed the Responsible Financial Innovation Act.The bill aims to tackle the classification of digital currencies as securities and non-securities. This is a subject on which US lawmakers, the SEC, and the CFTC have yet to agree.Gensler’s comments come at a tumultuous time for the digital asset space.The collapse of TerraUSD (USTC) and investor jitters over Fed monetary policy have weighed on investor sentiment.US regulatory uncertainty also remains a crypto market impediment.Earlier this year, lawmakers sent a letter to the SEC Chair questioning the SEC’s approach toward crypto firms. Lawmakers raised concerns that the SEC could stymy innovation. The letter was bipartisan, with both sides of the aisle co-signing the letter.With the SEC and the CFTC failing to find common ground, lawmakers may solve the issue.Neither are likely to give up without a fight. Lawmakers and regulators anticipate continued growth in the digital asset space.Until the US crypto market has clarity on the regulatory front, the SEC will continue to target crypto firms. A resolution could be around the corner, however.This week could prove pivotal, with a court ruling on an SEC motion to protect William Hinman speech-related documents under the attorney-client privilege expected.In 2018, the former SEC Director of the Division of Corporation Finance stated that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are not securities.The SEC case against Ripple Lab has been ongoing since December 2020. For lawmakers, the outcome could be decisive on who oversees the digital asset space.The SEC alleges that Ripple raised over $1.3bn through an unregistered, ongoing digital asset securities offering.On Tuesday, Stuart Alderoty, General Counsel for Ripple, talked about the failures to come to a consensus on how to classify cryptos.Taking aim at the SEC, Alderoty said,“4 years since the (in)famous Hinman speech, and we’re nowhere closer to knowing how to classify digital assets in the US – keeping every crypto, including ETH, in regulatory limbo.”With the SEC v Ripple case hanging in the balance, a former SEC employee speech could ultimately decide who regulates the digital asset space.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireFashion retailer H&M’s March-May sales jump a forecast-beating 17%UK confident it can overturn legal ban on Rwanda plan – ministerTop S.Korean economic, finance officials to meet ThursdayBiden’s approval falls in third straight week, nears record low -Reuters/IpsosEuro jumps on unscheduled ECB meeting, dollar towers ahead of FedGlobal tech on edge as WTO weighs e-commerce tariffsBitcoin price dives to $20,000, Ethereum’s ether tested the $1,000 zone, and BNB is struggling to stay above the key $200 support.As Bitcoin fell below $21,000 today, it took most of the altcoins along with it leaving less than a dozen cryptos to lead the recovery.After over $1 billion in liquidations over 24 hours, DeFi’s wild west period may be drawing to a close – but not everything’s a sham.The crypto market did not take a break from its downtrend streak even yesterday despite painting red for an entire week as altcoins sinked further today.Woolies and other big businesses will roll out the $40 wage hike in July, but smaller retailers are nervous.

Here’s how you can get reimbursed for your damaged cash.","Crypto market conditions calmed on Tuesday, with the broader market ending extended losing streaks.Ethereum (ETH) bucked the trend, falling for an eighth consecutive day, with bitcoin (BTC) also seeing red.The choppy session saw the total crypto market cap fall by $69 billion to a new current-year low of $858.7bn before late support kicked in.It was a mixed session for the crypto market on Tuesday. While the broader crypto market ended an extended losing streak, the bitcoin (BTC) fell for an eighth consecutive day.The eighth day in the red saw bitcoin fall to a new current-year low of $20,838 before a partial recovery to $22,000. Bitcoin last stood at sub-$21,000 in December 2020.Helium (HNT) was a front runner, while Monero (XMR) and Tron (TRX) saw heavy losses.Dip buyers delivered much-needed support ahead of the Fed’s monetary policy decision on Wednesday, which has weighed on the crypto market.Following Monday’s $130.6 billion wipeout, the total crypto market cap fell by just $3.6 billion on Tuesday.Significantly, however, the market cap fell to a new current-year low of $858.6 billion before returning to $900 billion. Tuesday’s decline marked the eighth consecutive daily fall.For June alone, the total crypto market cap is currently down $379 billion, following a $380 billion tumble in May and a $375 billion slump in April.While the crypto market found support on Tuesday, downside risks remain as the market looks ahead to the Fed monetary policy decision on Wednesday.The markets have priced in a 50 basis point rate hike. A hike in line with expectations would leave investors to focus on the Fed’s inflation, GDP, and interest rate projections.Investor fear of a more aggressive rate path trajectory has hit riskier assets. An upward revision to the March projections will likely further test the appetite for riskier assets.Other market considerations include plans to roll out more stringent regulatory measures and the stability of stablecoins.On Tuesday, TRX came under selling pressure as investors reacted to algorithmic stablecoin USDD losing its dollar peg. TRX slumped by 12.9% on Tuesday, following a 16.1% slide on Monday.From the top ten cryptos, ADA (+3.88%), SOL (+3.46%), and XRP (+3.41%) led the way.BNB (+0.09%) and DOGE (+2.69%) also found support.BTC slid by a further 1.58% to lead the way down, however, with ETH ending the day with a 0.02% loss to buck the broader market trend.From the CoinMarketCap top 100, Monero (XMR) joined TRX in the deep red, with a loss of 10.83%.Following Tuesday’s spike, total liquidations eased going into the Wednesday session.According to Coinglass, 24-hour liquidations stood at $578 million, down from $1,070 million levels on the day prior. While down from Tuesday levels, however, 24-hour liquidation levels remained elevated.One-hour liquidations pointed to a steadying in market cap conditions, with one-hour liquidations at $7.7 million.Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey took another swipe at the crypto market.Crypto investors prep for the Fed monetary policy decision and projections.Tron (TRX) took a hit in response to algorithmic stablecoin USDD losing its dollar peg.Ripple general counsel Stuart Alderoty took aim at the SEC over a muddied regulatory environment.BlockFi was fined $943,000 for failing to register securities in the State of Iowa.While the crypto winter takes its toll on crypto platforms, Ripple Labs, Binance, and Tron announced upbeat plans.CEO and co-founder of Terraform Labs Do Kwon denied cashing out $2.7 billion.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireOil prices edge higher, but expected U.S. interest rate hike loomsAnalysis-Golden age of buses?

Here are the suburbs they should be looking at.","Bitcoin SV rallied the highest among all altcoins, with an almost 37.4% rise.Monero led the down-trending cryptos losing almost 11% in 24 hours.On the other hand, the leaders of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, remained consolidated.Most of the investors were expecting green candles across the board on the charts today, however, the crypto market did not lean in their favor. While a couple of cryptocurrencies marked significant rises, most others continued declining.Well, not the kind one would want, but for the last 24 hours, XMR has been leading the altcoins that stuck to the week-long bearish sentiment and depreciated further. At the time of writing, XMR was trading at $120.39, 11% below the close from the day before. In the span of mere four days, the altcoin has plunged by 35.47% from the mark of $183. The coin, which had almost recovered from the crash of May 9, managed to test the 50-day Simple Moving Average as resistance and was on the verge of breaching it. Doing so would’ve allowed it to turn the SMA into support, maintaining the $200 price point.However, as the market crashed, the price indicators supporting the rise also switched their directions. MACD exhibited a bearish crossover just as XMR began declining, and at the time of writing, the bearishness on the indicator is diminishing any chances of recovery. This could result in the coin further decreasing unless the broader market sentiment turns bullish in the next few hours.The Bitcoin namesake and hard fork of the king coin’s hard fork, Bitcoin SV, surprisingly managed to prevent excessive damage during the crash. The altcoin only noted depreciation for 48 hours as it countered the bearishness over the week, declining by merely 18.65%.At the same time, in the last 24 hours, it almost not only recovered from the entire downfall but also rallied further ahead. With a 37.44% rally, BSV hit the monthly highs of $63.88 before coming back down to close at $51.28.This single-day rise triggered an uptrend for the altcoin, which is evident in the Parabolic SAR’s white dots’ position underneath the candlesticks. Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) recovered from falling deeper into the bearish zone by sitting closer to the neutral zone. Thus if the bearishness does impact BSV’s price action, it would still be far away from slipping into the oversold zone.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireHKMA buys HK$9.255 billion from market as currency hits weak end of trading bandOil prices slip ahead of expected U.S. Fed interest rate hikeAustralia’s minimum wage to rise 5.2%Second suspect arrested in case of missing British reporter in Brazil’s Amazon – policeU.S. rebuffs China by calling Taiwan Strait an international waterwayEurope regulator sees no safety concern in A350 paint disputeThe S&P; 500 has rallied to snap a five-session losing skid after a policy announcement by the Federal Reserve that raised interest rates to market expectations as the US central bank seeks to fight rising inflation without sparking a recession.The Federal Reserve raised its target interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point - its biggest rate hike since 1994 - and projected a slowing economy and rising unemployment in the months to come.After a week of announcements in NSW to improve the affordability of childcare and early learning, today Victorian parents are getting a turn.
