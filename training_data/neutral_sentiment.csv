0,"A seemingly cheap stock market may not yet be cheap enough given rising risks to corporate profits from red-hot inflation and rising interest rates, Goldman Sachs warns.""Despite the 18% year to date S&P 500 decline, equity valuations remain far from depressed,"" Goldman Sachs Chief U.S. Equity Strategist David Kostin wrote in a new note to clients. ""Valuations appear more attractive in the context of interest rates, but still do not look cheap.""Kostin added that analyst estimates for corporate earnings still look too high while recent news flow from companies has been concerning.""Valuations dominated investor focus in early 2022, but recent client conversations have centered on risks to EPS estimates, he wrote. ""Company announcements have added to these concerns. Just weeks after shares fell by 25% on disappointing 1Q margins, Target cut margin guidance this week as it struggles to manage excess inventory. Investors have also focused on a string of downbeat comments from tech companies. In recent weeks firms including Amazon, Microsoft, and Nvidia have signaled intentions to slow hiring. This development is positive in terms of balancing the labor market but reflects management anxiety about growth and inflation.""To be sure, the latest spate of economic news has poked a hole in the notion of valuations being attractive despite the market's pullback.The Michigan Consumer Sentiment reading tanked 14% in June compared to May, bringing the index to the trough hit in the middle of the 1980 recession, and consumers' assessments of their personal financial situation worsened about 20%. According to UMich, about 46% of consumers attributed their negative views on their financial situation to high levels of inflation.The Consumer Price Index, meanwhile, surged 8.6% in May from one year ago. That represented the fastest increase since December 1981.Economists expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by 50 basis points at its policy meeting this week and signal further aggressive hikes to curb inflation as that would serve as another anchor to stock valuations.Kostin isn't entirely bearish on stocks: The strategist views dividend-paying stocks as ""particularly attractively valued.""""Dividend stocks typically outperform in environments of elevated inflation. In addition, dividends currently benefit from the buffer of strong corporate balance sheets,"" Kostin wrote.Several stocks Kostin highlights that have ""above average"" dividend yields include Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Ford, UPS, IBM, Intel, Broadcom and HP.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

AVGO, Carriage Services CSV and Sempra Energy SRE.The U.S. stock market has been struggling this year as high inflation, soaring yields, Fed's policy tightening and Russia's invasion in Ukraine continue to weigh on investor sentiment. Against this backdrop, the appeal for dividend investing has been in vogue. Though the strategy doesn't offer dramatic price appreciation, it is a major source of consistent income for investors in any type of market.Honing in on stocks with a history of dividend growth leads to a healthy portfolio, with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields.

There are higher labor costs. There are higher fuel prices, higher transport and logistics prices, higher commodities prices, and some of these are going to come off, but they won't come off all at the same time.”Hazen recently joined the show to discuss personal consumption expenditures (PCE), inflation, market growth, and the outlook for the Fed ahead of its Federal Open Market Committee meeting (FOMC) next week.Before the Fed begins “to ease off the brakes,” Hazen explains that inflation needs to be “down well below 5%” and “we don’t know how quickly that can happen.” Because of uncertainty and volatility, Hazen states “the Fed is going to stay hawkish through the rest of the year.” The Fed has already begun quantitative tightening (QT) earlier this month, seeking to drain the $9 trillion currently on its balance sheet. Hazen also said that the Fed coming “to the rescue” is unlikely. “The 30-plus-year bull market in interest rates is over, and from here on in, rates are going to be higher.” The market is expecting as many as 7 rate hikes this year.To hedge against inflation, Hazen is “looking at companies that have high free cash flow generation.” She cited “food and staples retailing” companies “like CVS (CVS), which generates over 100% of free cash flow every year and is trading at 12 times earnings, with a 13% free cash flow yield.” She said she's also ""looking at companies like Broadcom (AVGO), which generates 200% free cash flow to net income.”For the coming months, it’s unclear when inflation could return to 2%. But in an era of slowing economic growth, ""you really need to look for companies that have strong free cash flow generation"" Hazen said.Yaseen Shah is a writer at Yahoo Finance.

The GARP approach leads to the identification of stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis.Further, the strategy helps investors in gaining exposure to stocks that have impressive prospects and are trading at a discount. GARP stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.That means a portfolio created on the basis of GARP strategy is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.The GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of both value and growth investing. Investors adopting the GARP approach will prefer to buy stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS), and so on.Growth MetricsBoth strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE).

Per a data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on May 16, 2022, the output of integrated circuits in the country in April dropped 12.1% on a year-over-year basis to 25.9 billion units, the lowest since December 2020.Further, the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war is aggravating the supply-chain situation as both countries produce key raw materials like palladium and neon gas, needed for semiconductor manufacturing.In spite of the current headwinds, the industry is witnessing consistent growth. This is evident from its robust performance in April 2022.Per the latest report from the Semiconductor Industry Association, global semiconductor industry sales were $50.9 billion in April, with a respective year-over-year and a sequential increase of 21.1% and 0.7%.The report further states that global sales jumped more than 20% on a year-to-year basis for 13 consecutive months, driven by rising demand for semiconductors across various sectors.Compared to April 2021’s reading, sales in the Americas, Europe, Japan, the Asia Pacific/All Other, and China were up 40.9%, 19.2%, 18.5%, 18.1% and 13.3%, respectively.Swelling demand for consumer electronics, automotive, industrial tools & equipment, and networking & communication products is creating growth in the semiconductor industry. Increasing adoption of AI, IoT, virtual reality by various industries like healthcare, defense and retail remain key catalysts.Rising popularity of remote-working and online learning is driving demand for processors used in enterprise laptops and data center servers, thereby propelling the semiconductor space.Further, the dominant position of the United States in the global semiconductor market plays an important role. Notably, the country allocated $52 billion to investment in the semiconductor industry.The governments of other major economies are also making heavy investments to meet the spike in chip demand and reduce dependency on imports.Last month, the government of Spain announced spending €12.25 billion on the semiconductor and microchip industry by 2027.In December 2021, the government of India announced a package of $9.81 billion for the development of semiconductors and display of manufacturing ecosystems. Moreover, India and Taiwan are in talks to set up a semiconductor manufacturing hub in India by a Taiwanese company.These factors are expected to consistently drive growth in the semiconductor industry in the near term and the long haul.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the value of the semiconductor industry landscape was $549.2 billion in 2021. It also states that the industry is expected to be worth $906.3 billion by 2027, witnessing a CAGR of 8.23% between 2022 and 2027.Given the upbeat scenario, here are four semiconductor stocks that are well poised to capitalize on the above-mentioned prospects. Apart from strong fundamentals, these stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of A or B. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Monolithic Power Systems MPWR is benefiting from solid demand across the automotive, industrial, computing and storage, and communications markets. MPWR is on track to expand capacity in 2022 well beyond $2 billion, which will ramp up new product revenues. It is likely to gain from the rapid deployment of 5G on the back of a robust portfolio of legacy routers, wireless applications and 5G networking infrastructure-related products.Further, Monolithic Power Systems is witnessing sales growth in infotainment, lighting and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems products in the automotive market, which remains a positive. Moreover, MPWR’s deep-rooted partnerships with leading auto suppliers are expected to continue driving its top line in the days ahead.Monolithic Power Systems, currently flaunting a Zacks Rank of 1, has a Growth Score of B. The long-term earnings growth rate for the stock is currently projected at 25%.Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. QuoteMaxLinear MXL is continuously gaining from the solid momentum in broadband access, connectivity, infrastructure and industrial multi-markets. Growing platform design wins across multiple geographies in new end markets also remain beneficial for the company.In addition, MXL is consistently working toward bringing advanced solutions to gain momentum among customers. It recently introduced a fully integrated SoC named Sierra for 4G/5G Open RAN radio units. Further, MaxLinear’s MxL1600 family of RF Transceivers is selected by a leading provider of wireless network solutions, ZHT, for its 5G radio remote unit small cells.

The long-term earnings growth rate for the stock is currently projected at 20%.MaxLinear, Inc price-consensus-chart | MaxLinear, Inc QuoteBroadcom AVGO is benefiting from strength in the networking and server storage segments. AVGO’s networking is further riding on the strong adoption of its next-gen merchant switching and routing solutions by hyperscalers, enterprises and service providers.Moreover, a higher uptake of AVGO’s next-generation server storage solutions by hyperscalers is expected to drive top-line growth. Notably, Broadcom expects third-quarter fiscal 2022 networking and server storage revenues to grow more than 25% and 60% on a year-over-year basis, respectively. Further, the recently-announced VMware acquisition will aid prospects over the long term.Broadcom has a Zacks Rank of 2 and a Growth Score of A, currently.

QuoteVishay Intertechnology VSH is steadily gaining from its robust resistor, diode, MOSFET, capacitor and opto product lines. Further, a recovery in the automotive sector and strong momentum across the medical and military markets are driving the top line.In addition, Vishay Intertechnology’s robust magnetics is continuously driving the specialty business. Further, growing momentum across the areas of power transmission and electro cars with the help of robust capacitors is a tailwind. Additionally, VSH’s firm focus on expanding its manufacturing capacities remains a major lever.Vishay Intertechnology is currently Zacks #2 Ranked and has a Growth Score of B.

The GARP approach leads to the identification of stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis.Further, the strategy helps investors in gaining exposure to stocks that have impressive prospects and are trading at a discount. GARP stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.That means a portfolio created on the basis of GARP strategy is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.The GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of both value and growth investing. Investors adopting the GARP approach will prefer to buy stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS), and so on.Growth MetricsBoth strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.
