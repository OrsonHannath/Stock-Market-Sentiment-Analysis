1,"The Responsible Financial Innovation Act aims to give digital asset oversight powers to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).While the crypto market views such an outcome as crypto market-friendly, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has other ideas.On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Gensler is dissatisfied with lawmaker plans.Regulatory chatter continues to grab the crypto headlines in what has become a busy year for lawmakers and regulators. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has not been far from the headlines, with the SEC eyeing the task of regulating the digital asset space.Last week, we reported on a likely battle between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over the appointment to regulate digital currencies.The report was in response to a bipartisan bill beginning its passage on Capitol Hill, which looks to give the CFTC the coveted job of overseeing the digital asset space.On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported SEC Chair Gary Gensler raised concern over lawmaker legislation that “could compromise regulations that govern the broader capital markets.”Gensler held back from commenting directly on the bipartisan Lummis and Gillibrand bill.The SEC Chair did say,“We don’t want to undermine the protections we have in a $100 trillion capital market.”Adding,“Like behaviors should have like treatment.”Last week, US senators Cynthia Lummis and Republican Kirsten Gillibrand filed the Responsible Financial Innovation Act.The bill aims to tackle the classification of digital currencies as securities and non-securities. This is a subject on which US lawmakers, the SEC, and the CFTC have yet to agree.Gensler’s comments come at a tumultuous time for the digital asset space.The collapse of TerraUSD (USTC) and investor jitters over Fed monetary policy have weighed on investor sentiment.US regulatory uncertainty also remains a crypto market impediment.Earlier this year, lawmakers sent a letter to the SEC Chair questioning the SEC’s approach toward crypto firms. Lawmakers raised concerns that the SEC could stymy innovation. The letter was bipartisan, with both sides of the aisle co-signing the letter.With the SEC and the CFTC failing to find common ground, lawmakers may solve the issue.Neither are likely to give up without a fight. Lawmakers and regulators anticipate continued growth in the digital asset space.Until the US crypto market has clarity on the regulatory front, the SEC will continue to target crypto firms. A resolution could be around the corner, however.This week could prove pivotal, with a court ruling on an SEC motion to protect William Hinman speech-related documents under the attorney-client privilege expected.In 2018, the former SEC Director of the Division of Corporation Finance stated that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are not securities.The SEC case against Ripple Lab has been ongoing since December 2020. For lawmakers, the outcome could be decisive on who oversees the digital asset space.The SEC alleges that Ripple raised over $1.3bn through an unregistered, ongoing digital asset securities offering.On Tuesday, Stuart Alderoty, General Counsel for Ripple, talked about the failures to come to a consensus on how to classify cryptos.Taking aim at the SEC, Alderoty said,“4 years since the (in)famous Hinman speech, and we’re nowhere closer to knowing how to classify digital assets in the US – keeping every crypto, including ETH, in regulatory limbo.”With the SEC v Ripple case hanging in the balance, a former SEC employee speech could ultimately decide who regulates the digital asset space.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireFashion retailer H&M’s March-May sales jump a forecast-beating 17%UK confident it can overturn legal ban on Rwanda plan – ministerTop S.Korean economic, finance officials to meet ThursdayBiden’s approval falls in third straight week, nears record low -Reuters/IpsosEuro jumps on unscheduled ECB meeting, dollar towers ahead of FedGlobal tech on edge as WTO weighs e-commerce tariffsBitcoin price dives to $20,000, Ethereum’s ether tested the $1,000 zone, and BNB is struggling to stay above the key $200 support.As Bitcoin fell below $21,000 today, it took most of the altcoins along with it leaving less than a dozen cryptos to lead the recovery.After over $1 billion in liquidations over 24 hours, DeFi’s wild west period may be drawing to a close – but not everything’s a sham.The crypto market did not take a break from its downtrend streak even yesterday despite painting red for an entire week as altcoins sinked further today.Woolies and other big businesses will roll out the $40 wage hike in July, but smaller retailers are nervous.

Here’s how you can get reimbursed for your damaged cash.","Crypto market conditions calmed on Tuesday, with the broader market ending extended losing streaks.Ethereum (ETH) bucked the trend, falling for an eighth consecutive day, with bitcoin (BTC) also seeing red.The choppy session saw the total crypto market cap fall by $69 billion to a new current-year low of $858.7bn before late support kicked in.It was a mixed session for the crypto market on Tuesday. While the broader crypto market ended an extended losing streak, the bitcoin (BTC) fell for an eighth consecutive day.The eighth day in the red saw bitcoin fall to a new current-year low of $20,838 before a partial recovery to $22,000. Bitcoin last stood at sub-$21,000 in December 2020.Helium (HNT) was a front runner, while Monero (XMR) and Tron (TRX) saw heavy losses.Dip buyers delivered much-needed support ahead of the Fed’s monetary policy decision on Wednesday, which has weighed on the crypto market.Following Monday’s $130.6 billion wipeout, the total crypto market cap fell by just $3.6 billion on Tuesday.Significantly, however, the market cap fell to a new current-year low of $858.6 billion before returning to $900 billion. Tuesday’s decline marked the eighth consecutive daily fall.For June alone, the total crypto market cap is currently down $379 billion, following a $380 billion tumble in May and a $375 billion slump in April.While the crypto market found support on Tuesday, downside risks remain as the market looks ahead to the Fed monetary policy decision on Wednesday.The markets have priced in a 50 basis point rate hike. A hike in line with expectations would leave investors to focus on the Fed’s inflation, GDP, and interest rate projections.Investor fear of a more aggressive rate path trajectory has hit riskier assets. An upward revision to the March projections will likely further test the appetite for riskier assets.Other market considerations include plans to roll out more stringent regulatory measures and the stability of stablecoins.On Tuesday, TRX came under selling pressure as investors reacted to algorithmic stablecoin USDD losing its dollar peg. TRX slumped by 12.9% on Tuesday, following a 16.1% slide on Monday.From the top ten cryptos, ADA (+3.88%), SOL (+3.46%), and XRP (+3.41%) led the way.BNB (+0.09%) and DOGE (+2.69%) also found support.BTC slid by a further 1.58% to lead the way down, however, with ETH ending the day with a 0.02% loss to buck the broader market trend.From the CoinMarketCap top 100, Monero (XMR) joined TRX in the deep red, with a loss of 10.83%.Following Tuesday’s spike, total liquidations eased going into the Wednesday session.According to Coinglass, 24-hour liquidations stood at $578 million, down from $1,070 million levels on the day prior. While down from Tuesday levels, however, 24-hour liquidation levels remained elevated.One-hour liquidations pointed to a steadying in market cap conditions, with one-hour liquidations at $7.7 million.Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey took another swipe at the crypto market.Crypto investors prep for the Fed monetary policy decision and projections.Tron (TRX) took a hit in response to algorithmic stablecoin USDD losing its dollar peg.Ripple general counsel Stuart Alderoty took aim at the SEC over a muddied regulatory environment.BlockFi was fined $943,000 for failing to register securities in the State of Iowa.While the crypto winter takes its toll on crypto platforms, Ripple Labs, Binance, and Tron announced upbeat plans.CEO and co-founder of Terraform Labs Do Kwon denied cashing out $2.7 billion.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireOil prices edge higher, but expected U.S. interest rate hike loomsAnalysis-Golden age of buses?

Here are the suburbs they should be looking at.","Bitcoin SV rallied the highest among all altcoins, with an almost 37.4% rise.Monero led the down-trending cryptos losing almost 11% in 24 hours.On the other hand, the leaders of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, remained consolidated.Most of the investors were expecting green candles across the board on the charts today, however, the crypto market did not lean in their favor. While a couple of cryptocurrencies marked significant rises, most others continued declining.Well, not the kind one would want, but for the last 24 hours, XMR has been leading the altcoins that stuck to the week-long bearish sentiment and depreciated further. At the time of writing, XMR was trading at $120.39, 11% below the close from the day before. In the span of mere four days, the altcoin has plunged by 35.47% from the mark of $183. The coin, which had almost recovered from the crash of May 9, managed to test the 50-day Simple Moving Average as resistance and was on the verge of breaching it. Doing so would’ve allowed it to turn the SMA into support, maintaining the $200 price point.However, as the market crashed, the price indicators supporting the rise also switched their directions. MACD exhibited a bearish crossover just as XMR began declining, and at the time of writing, the bearishness on the indicator is diminishing any chances of recovery. This could result in the coin further decreasing unless the broader market sentiment turns bullish in the next few hours.The Bitcoin namesake and hard fork of the king coin’s hard fork, Bitcoin SV, surprisingly managed to prevent excessive damage during the crash. The altcoin only noted depreciation for 48 hours as it countered the bearishness over the week, declining by merely 18.65%.At the same time, in the last 24 hours, it almost not only recovered from the entire downfall but also rallied further ahead. With a 37.44% rally, BSV hit the monthly highs of $63.88 before coming back down to close at $51.28.This single-day rise triggered an uptrend for the altcoin, which is evident in the Parabolic SAR’s white dots’ position underneath the candlesticks. Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) recovered from falling deeper into the bearish zone by sitting closer to the neutral zone. Thus if the bearishness does impact BSV’s price action, it would still be far away from slipping into the oversold zone.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireHKMA buys HK$9.255 billion from market as currency hits weak end of trading bandOil prices slip ahead of expected U.S. Fed interest rate hikeAustralia’s minimum wage to rise 5.2%Second suspect arrested in case of missing British reporter in Brazil’s Amazon – policeU.S. rebuffs China by calling Taiwan Strait an international waterwayEurope regulator sees no safety concern in A350 paint disputeThe S&P; 500 has rallied to snap a five-session losing skid after a policy announcement by the Federal Reserve that raised interest rates to market expectations as the US central bank seeks to fight rising inflation without sparking a recession.The Federal Reserve raised its target interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point - its biggest rate hike since 1994 - and projected a slowing economy and rising unemployment in the months to come.After a week of announcements in NSW to improve the affordability of childcare and early learning, today Victorian parents are getting a turn.

The GARP approach leads to the identification of stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis.Further, the strategy helps investors in gaining exposure to stocks that have impressive prospects and are trading at a discount. GARP stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.That means a portfolio created on the basis of GARP strategy is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.The GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of both value and growth investing. Investors adopting the GARP approach will prefer to buy stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS), and so on.Growth MetricsBoth strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is also considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Along with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)Here are four of the six stocks that made it through the screen:Ulta Beauty ULTA is a leading beauty retailer in the United States, which offers a wide range of products, including cosmetics, fragrance, skincare, hair care, bath and body products, and salon styling tools in stores.

Networking is riding on strong adoption of Broadcom's next-gen merchant switching and routing solutions by hyperscalers, enterprises and service providers. Aggressive adoption of its next-generation server storage solutions by hyperscalers is expected to drive top-line growth.Broadcom expects fiscal third-quarter networking and server storage revenues to grow more than 25% and 60% on a year-over-year basis, respectively. An upbeat third-quarter fiscal 2022 guidance is encouraging. Recently announced VMware acquisition will aid prospects over the long term. However, increasing competition, along with high debt levels, are persistent overhangs.(You can read the full research report on Broadcom here >>>)Intel shares have declined -13.0% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry's decline of -25.1%. The Zacks analyst believes that the Client Computing Group is expected to suffer due to component shortage. Production delays pertaining to 7 nm ramp up remain a concern. A strained Sino-U.S. trade relationship, imposition of fresh lockdown restrictions in some markets, forex woes and high debt burden remain other concerns.However, despite short-term headwinds, the company expects demand to pick up in the second half of the year. The company is riding on prospects of the Internet of Things and Mobileye businesses. Mobileye growth should be driven by design wins amid recovering automotive industry. Recovery in the enterprise business of the data center segment is a positive.

Uptick in freight revenues (up 17% year over year in first-quarter 2022) as economic activities pick up the pace is an added positive.However, escalation in fuel costs (up 74% in the March quarter) as oil prices moved north induced a 16% rise in the operating expenses.
